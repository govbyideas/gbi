## Feedback, Remarks, Proposals
This document is to be seen as a seed from where a tree of different flavors is wished to arise.
As there is no reason that we all share the same way to develop this seed, the objective is to list
all these ways and be able to characterize them while still having the least branch possible
but as many as necessary for any group of people be able to choose the fruit that best
matches their taste.

I suggest using the [Issues menu](https://github.com/govbyideas/gbi/issues)
above to create discussions (or report typos...). But before creating
your own issue, check that one is not already open about your point, you should be able to participate
in any open issues and its related discussion.

At a time, any issue will be closed. I see different fates but this is not limitative:
- either the request/topic ends by being integrated in this seed document, because it has been seen as
unrestrictive for any development branch,
- or the issue owner (or a group of persons) decides to fork this repository and create their own version
of this document. I will then add below a pointer to this fork with a description that characterize
the reason of the fork,
- or the issue will be closed because after discussion the proposal does finally not match its place in the
seed document and the author's issue either changed his mind or has not the will to develop his point of view.

Such forks may well evolve and be much more elaborated than this original seed document. This is in fact
the intention of this seed: to serve as root to create different fruits. But this seed version (or branch)
can also receive contributions (if agreed by his author) and then become very elaborated too. I suggest
using the [pull_requests](https://github.com/govbyideas/gbi/pulls) above for that after having (temporarily or not)
forked the repository.

## Forks
here is expected to take place the list of existing and identified forks with a description that characterize them
