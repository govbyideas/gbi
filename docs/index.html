    <title>Direct Democracy - Governments By Ideas</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p align="justify">
      If you are tired of voting for a candidate and then to realize that once elected
      that he/she does not hold the promises and engagements he/she defended
      during the campaign, the following political system might interest you.
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      To avoid such pitfall, we should thus not elect persons, but just the
      &quot;ideas&quot;  the candidates pretend they would defend. The following is
      a proposal of such system and as a proposal is presented for feedback,
      comments and adaptations.
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      For brevity the political system hereafter described will be
      referred as <b>Government By Ideas</b> or in short <b>GBI</b>.
    </p>


    <h1>About the Author</h1>
    <p align="justify">
      The author is a simple citizen in France, employee
      in the private sector and not linked with any political party nor
      part of any lobby. He presents his work as a proposal and request
      for comments and has conscience that this is a work in progress.
    </p>

    <h1>Concept</h1>

    <p align="justify">
      The GBI aim is to provide an enhancement to democracy that puts
      the people closer to decisions and get them interested to the decision
      process, having them more frequently involved than once every 4 to 5
      years. As a side effect it should avoiding lobbies to decide in the
      place of people, thus lead the fight against corruption and putting
      back the state global interest at the center of the government
      actions.
    </p>

    <h1>Scope</h1>
    <p align="justify">
      GBI is not a substitute for justice, for police, for education,
      for healthcare, nor any other regalian services.
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      GBI's target is to have laws modified, created
      and withdrawn in order to adapt them to new realities a country is
      facing. It thus takes the role of a <b>legislative system</b> and also
      partially of an <b>executive system</b>. But GBI has not the role
      to enforce laws for what stays in the hands of police and justice.
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      As shortly explained previously, in addition to be a legislative
      system, GBI is a <b>partial executive system</b>. Why partial? Because GBI decision process
      need time and is not adapted to actions that must be taken quickly
      like defense, war, fight against terrorism and any other new situation
      that may arise putting the country at risk *and* needing fast decision.
      But action that engages the country regarding other countries (treaties,
      public foreign affairs) must not be excluded from GBI decision system.
      For that reason this is only a <b>partial executive power</b> where a
      president function is still needed and will have to be elected as per
      democracy usage.
    </p>


    <p align="justify" style="margin-left: 5%">
      <u>Risk:</u> risk is that such president or a group of
      person behind him take over the GBI by invoking imminent danger
      (like mass destruction weapons against us)
      to take action that else would be under the scope of GBI
    </p>

    <h1>Elections Process</h1>
    <h2>Ideas election</h2>

    <p align="justify">
      GBI means to not elect candidates but to elect ideas. Ideas have
      first to be presented and defined. This first step is open to any
      citizen without restriction, this is the idea not the author of the
      idea that is important at this step.
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      But to avoid the system to be overloaded under ideas, each submission
      should cost a symbolic fixed amount of money plus an amount
      proportional to the revenue of the submitter. Such amount should
      allow any working citizen even the ones with the smallest legal
      revenue to pay the submission of one idea per year and still having
      enough money to satisfy the minimum level of expenses required to
      live with dignity. The number of idea a person can present per year
      should probably not to be limited as we might have very good contributors as well
      also as very poor ones. But we will see that poor or defective ideas
      will just be ignored and will not cost much resource to anyone except its author.
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      Once an idea has been submitted to the system it receives an <u>Idea ID</u> that
      identifies it and will have to be voted for. An idea will be retained if a majority of
      registered voter approves it. Abstention is considered the same as
      rejecting an idea, but explicitly voting against an idea is possible
      and has some interest which will be detailed later. In consequence
      voting for a given idea shall not be mandatory.
    </p>

    <p align="justify" style="margin-left: 5%">
      <u>Risk:</u> here the risk is that no idea would get
      enough vote for the country to pass new laws in order to adapt to new
      needs. This is the way that forcibly lead people to be concerned by
      the life of their country for their problems to get solved. To be
      representative any idea cannot be adopted if less or equal than 50%
      of the electors have voted for it, <u>this clause is fundamental for GBI</u>.
    </p>

    <p align="justify" style="margin-left: 5%">
      The risk stays however that people could vote on orders or for
      retribution, or delegate their power to a given organism, this is
      however not a new risk compared to current democracy systems, but
      the pressure on voices acquisition could be stronger with GBI
      and thus should be looked at and penalized.
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      Limiting the number of idea per person and per time is not necessary
      as they will just be ignored if their submitter has either not put the
      means to make it known, understood and accepted, or if the submitted
      idea is just silly, useless, not interesting. No effort will be required
      to have it been purged from the GBI system.
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      The delay between voting and idea submission, is the time during which
      the idea is exposed to debate. The submitter will have to define this
      duration when submitting the idea and choose it in a way to maximize
      the number of votes and still not delay the idea too much in the future
      for it can be taken by electors as a solution to the current problems.
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      This is thus the duty of an idea submitter to make it known, understood,
      voted for and accepted. All mean are possible for that, including
      advertisement, social networks, emails... Debates could take place
      anywhere, usenet newsgroups, public meetings, emails, social media,
      whatever, but always clearly indicating the idea ID's they debate about,
      compare, valuate, promote or criticize. However unfair
      communication means that do not allow anyone to present its idea (TV
      broadcast, newspaper...) in particular when privately owned, should
      not be allowed to mention exposed idea and should be fined in case
      they would refer directly (Idea ID) or indirectly (title, tag,
      keywords) to an idea.
    </p>

    <p align="justify" style="margin-left: 5%">
      <u>Risk:</u>  the reason why to forbid unfair
      communication means to promote ideas is to reduce the risk of citizen
      brain washing (TV, newspaper...) by owners of such communication
      means, omitting to mention alternatives to ideas not in phase
      with their own ideology. This is thus a way to reduce the mean a lobby
      can have to influence people voting.
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      Once the exposition delay has been passed, the vote for an idea are
      counted and either the idea is adopted (if it has a majority of votes)
      or it is rejected (if not). There is no need to synchronize the time
      and date of votes between different ideas.
    </p>

    <p align="justify" style="margin-left: 5%">
      <u>Risk:</u> the strongest risk here is that GBI
      strongly need computer science based systems. Especially for voting,
      unlike physical vote where any citizen can check that there is no
      fraud in each vote center, and seen the publicly available result of
      each vote center checking that the global vote is true (but how many citizen
      take the time to do that today?), using computer science means
      completely removes the citizen control against fraud. A voting system
      is proposed in annex that leverage Internet access and tend to
      minimize fraud.
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      The fact voter can change their mind and the nature of their vote during
      the exposition period of an idea is interesting and should be possible
      (thanks to strong authentication system, see the proposal for a such
      system below).
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      It could also be defined that when the time remaining before end of vote
      is only a third of the total exposition time (for example), voter
      could not change their vote anymore, only elector not having yet
      voted could add their voice to or against the concerned idea.
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      having the information of vote number for ideas currently available for
      vote could be a possible option. In addition providing a top list of the
      most voted idea could be interesting to compensate the 50 % minimum
      requested electors giving their voice for an idea to be adopted.
    </p>

    <h2>Super-Ideas</h2>
    <p align="justify">
      An idea can be dependent on another one. Each idea will thus have a
      dependency list (eventually void), but cyclic dependency (idea A
      depends on idea B which itself depends on idea A) should not be
      allowed. We will design by super-idea such idea that relies on at
      least another idea.
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      A new idea could thus list a set of other existing ideas (by their
      idea's ID) and voting for it would imply voting for all ideas it
      depends on. Of course an elector could not vote for an idea if this
      one has in its dependency list an idea the voter has already
      explicitly voted against. However the elector can still vote for any
      other idea presented in the dependency list of this super-idea, but
      not for the super-idea itself. This way an elector could vote against
      some ideas and see what's left to vote for.
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      A super-idea could also be listed in the dependency list of another
      idea. This way, a given idea could be referred in the dependency list
      of many other ideas, directly or indirectly, making a tree of ideas.
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      In addition to that, an idea could also be referred by several different
      super idea trees making common branches between these trees.
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      We could imagine political party proving their own super-ideas and their
      set of dependent ideas. We could also imagine some other
      political party borrowing some sub-ideas from a first party by adding
      them in the dependency list of their master super-idea (directly or
      not). Though any citizen could decide to vote for any leaf-idea
      whatever is the party or citizen it has been submitted by as well as
      for super-ideas that have this leaf-idea in their dependency list,
      leading the ideas common to different political party to have more
      chance to be elected.
    </p>

    <h2>Minister</h2>
    <p align="justify">
      Now that an idea has been retained thanks to the idea election process
      described above, a person has to be selected (not elected, but
      randomly chosen - see chapter for that topic) to implement it. Any
      people that has the right to vote and has not been condemned for
      corruption in their live can postulate for a given idea. The selected
      candidate will be called the minister for this idea. A person cannot
      be minister for two different ideas at the same time. But a person
      can be minister as many times as he has postulated and been selected in
      his life.
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      The role of the minister will be to implement the idea, that's it to
      define all the necessary for this idea to become applicable in the
      perimeter described by this idea submitter. He will also have the
      duty to regularly provide action status: what has been done so far,
      what stays to be done, what are the problem met today to go forward,
      and so on. The frequency of these action status are defined by the
      author's idea.
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      If a super-idea has been elected, a minister for this super-idea will
      have the duty to implement the whole tree of dependent ideas (see
      Ministerial Cabinet below). There will not be minister selection for
      any of the sub-idea of this super-idea.
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      However if two elected super-ideas have the same idea in their
      dependency list, or depend on the same branch of ideas (a common branch
      of ideas between two elected trees), this sub-idea
      or this branch of ideas they depend on will have a dedicated minister
      and will be removed from the responsibility of the super-idea ministers.
      If any such super-idea need first thus sub-idea or sub-branch to be
      implemented in order to start, it will be delayed. This is the
      minister decision to define when the implementation work for an idea
      starts, is suspended and ends. He will also have to justify his
      decision as defined by the idea submitter at least during the planned
      action status reports.
    </p>

    <h2>Censors</h2>

    <p align="justify">
      In parallel to minister candidates, censors have to be selected
      (randomly chosen from the list of censor candidates) for a given idea
      to control that the actions status provided by the minister are true
      and sincere. Censor could trigger Justice if there is significant
      difference between actions status report done by the minister and
      reality of facts, or if the action performed would be outside the
      perimeter of the original idea. A minister could be this way revoked
      and condemned. He would not be allowed anymore to postulate for a
      role of minister for the rest of his life. If the judgment does not
      retain the minister to be guilty, the sensor should not be
      prosecuted, unless he triggered justice without strong enough
      reasons to do so. In that case he may be condemned for censorship abuse. A
      censor could be condemned up to three time for abuse in his life
      (being censor for the same idea or for another one), after that he
      won't be able to be selected as censors for the rest of his life.
      No other penalty should be applied in case of censorship abuse.
    </p>

    <p align="justify" style="margin-left: 5%">
      <u><b>Risk:</b></u> if censors do not feel free to investigate and
      if necessary, to trigger the Justice, the risk is that this role will serve
      no purpose. However a mechanism must exist to prevent abuse. The fact
      the sensor is randomly chosen for an idea reduce the risk but does not
      remove it completely that a set of persons consider their role of
      censor in regard of the selected minister not in regard to the action
      he performs in regard to the idea definition and expectations
      (opposite/different political party or human conflict), or worse in regard to the nature
      of the idea itself (idea the censor does not like would receive a lot of
      "investigation" against the minister, or an idea the censor approves
      would receive little or no control for its execution by the minister...).
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      If a super-idea has been elected, there will not be a super-censors, but
      as many censor as there is ideas and sub-ideas. This rule will make sense with
      minister cabinet described below. The resource censorship must not be reduced
      for the level of control to be independent from the super-idea hierarchy and
      selected minister(s) to implement them.
    </p>

    <p align="justify" style="margin-left: 5%">
      <b><u>Note:</u></b> An alternative to having a censor per idea is to define
      professionals/officials independent from the number of ideas.
      The history showed that such public human resources tend to
      be reduced over time in the expenses reduction plans. The consequences
      would be a lack of control on the execution of elected idea and probably
      the same drawback as current system, where a (s)elected person does not
      execute the expected actions (implementing another idea than the one
      people have voted for).
    </p>

    <h1>What must contain an Idea</h1>

    An idea is not just an idea, it must define means that will be provided
    to implement it

    <h2>Objective</h2>

    <p align="justify">
      The objective describes the idea by itself. For example &quot;<i>reduce the maximum
      authorized speed for motorized vehicles to 110 km/h on motorways</i>&quot; is
      an objective. However this ideas implies defining penalties to driver
      that would be caught above the speed, providing mean to indicate the
      maximum speed, measure the impact of the speed reduction on
      pollution, people health, economy and so on.
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      The objective of a super-idea must be coherent with its child ideas.
    </p>

    <p align="justify" style="margin-left: 5%">
      <u>Risk:</u> is that one person or an organism could hides
      in the idea-tree some ideas that implement the opposite of the
      super-idea, leading people to be trumped.  A penalty system against
      idea submitter would be difficult to be defined. Though the fact the idea submitter
      and the minister are different persons should reduce such abuse. In
      that case if the minister can demonstrate that the super-idea he has
      to implement lists ideas that tend to propose the opposite action of the
      super-idea, he can be granted to not implement this sub-idea. The minister
      will issue a <i>idea extension</i> (see below) to redefine the perimeter of
      the super idea explaining why he wants to remove certain sub-idea(s).
      The elector that voted for this idea will be notified of this idea extension
      and will have to vote for or against this extension.
    </p>

    <h2>Time span</h2>

    <p align="justify">
      An idea must define a maximum duration of execution, it must also define
      the frequency of action status reports the minister would have to
      provide. Once the maximum duration has passed the minister ends his role
      whatever is the status of the idea. After that time the implementation
      evaluation process starts.
    </p>

    <h2>Budget</h2>

    <p align="justify">
      Each idea should provide a budget for its implementation. A separated
      budget (compensation budget) would define the amount of money that
      the minister and his team (see Ministerial Cabinet below) will be
      allocated for the whole time span of this idea. An amount will also
      be allocated for sensors. An idea submitter cannot reduce the amount redeeming
      the censors below a minimum level, it can however define a higher
      amount. At the opposite, the compensation budget for minister can be
      zero, but maybe then no candidate will postulate for such idea as
      interesting as it can be for the society.
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      A super-idea can have his own budget, but it must also list the sum of
      all budgets of the child ideas recursively for an elector to see the
      global cost of what he can vote for or against.
    </p>

    <h2>Perimeter</h2>

    <p align="justify">
      The idea should define a perimeter outside which the action should not
      apply (in our example this might be that wind or human powered
      vehicles should not be concerned by this speed limitation).
    </p>

    <h2>Idea ID</h2>

    <p align="justify">
      Last an Idea ID is attributed by the system once the idea has been duly
      registered. Such ID must be chosen for the distance between two IDs
      differs from at least three characters (a typo of one or two characters
      should not lead to a valid ID). For the same reason, only either the O
      letter or 0 digit should be used inside idea identifiers.
    </p>

    <h1>Ministerial Cabinet</h1>

    <p align="justify">
      A minister may appoint other persons (experts, specialists,...) in order
      to get help addressing his goal. He will then share with them the
      compensation budget equally during their time of presence, these
      persons will constitute the Ministerial Cabinet. The minister has all
      power to modify his cabinet at any time. The budget will be shared
      prorata temporis of presence in the Ministerial Cabinet.
    </p>

    <p align="justify" style="margin-left: 5%">
      <u><b>Risk:</b></u> a minister may delegate his role to a so called expert
      that will bypass the random selection system of candidates. In the other
      hand a minister cannot be hampered in its action for the pretext he
      engaged a expert that takes over his role... Puppet politician already
      exist today, how to reduce this risk here?
    <p>

    <h1>Ideas extension</h1>

    <p align="justify">
      It may arise that some idea get almost realized but not completely and
      having the same minister and ministerial cabinet to completely
      achieve them would make more sense that performing again the whole
      process of idea election. In that situation, an idea-extension can be
      submitted by the minister. All voter for the original idea will get
notified by such idea extension, but still a majority of electors
      will have to vote for it for the extension to be granted. Elector
      that explicitly voted against such idea will also be notified.
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      Idea extension may concern time span extension and/or budget extension
      and/or perimeter extension. It will have to be justified in order for
      voter to understand and agree with it. The censor may amend or
      annotate the explanation of the minister, he may also trigger the
      justice if the extension differs too much from the original idea. The
      exposition delay is, here too, defined by the idea submitter (here
      the minister), to find a good balance between the remaining time to
      realize the idea and the necessary time to obtain the necessary vote
      quorum. If elected, such idea extension does not lead to candidate
      selection, this is the minister that will implement it.
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      Idea extension can also be used by the minister when there is conflict
      between a sub-idea and a super-idea or between ideas of a tree he has
      the charge to implement. This may lead to the withdrawal of a sub-idea
      that has an opposite goal of the super idea people have been voted for.
    </p>

    <h1>End of execution</h1>
    <p align="justify">
	An minister and associated sensors ends their role once the maximum
	duration time for the idea has ended. Minister or censor may also
	resign in which case they will have to refund the money they received
	for their role, unless major force (decease, diseases duly
	validated,...)
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      the elector that have been voting for this idea get notified and can
      provide a mark on the way the idea has been executed. This notation
      will increase or decrease the minister selection weight which will
      either reduce its chance to be selected or increase its chance to be
      selected as minister if he postulates for a minister role in the future.
    </p>


    <h1>Tax System</h1>
    <h2>Citizens</h2>

    <p align="justify">
      The budget sum of all ideas accepted during a given year is added to the
      tax amount that will be applied to citizen the next year. An idea
      that span several years will have a proportional fraction of its
      budget allocated each year. Each idea may define the way its budget
      will be allocated over time (for example 80 % the first year, and 5 %
      the four next years).
      </p>

    <p align="justify">
      The way to balance this taxation between people (what we will call
      taxation model) based or not on their revenue, patrimony, age,
      volunteer in general interest cause... is outside the scope of the
      GBI.
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      When voting for an idea, voters will see the cost they will have to pay
      for this idea, in regard to the existing taxation model and their
      position in that taxation model.
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      It should be provisioned enough money to address the budget in regard to
      past years expenses and currently running ideas. If provision is not
      large enough, firstly voted ideas of the year will be active, the
      other will stay pending for budget or at the will of the minister
      will start without fund or with privately owned funds, reimbursed
      later to the minister. The state has not to carry any interest for
      the loan if it could not provide the necessary fund for the idea to
      be active. A pending idea is one that has been elected but not
      started and its described time span is shifted up to the time budget
      will be available.
    </p>

    <p align="justify" style="margin-left: 5%">
      <u>Risk:</u> the lack of provision may lead the idea
      submissions to take place at a given time of the year to have more
      chance to get a budget sooner, leading to race between ideas in
      regard to the time schedule to have its budget allocated sooner.
    </p>


    <h2>Companies</h2>

        <p align="justify">
	  As companies have no right to vote for ideas, they shall not be taxed to
	  setup the budget of any idea. However companies do consume resources
	  (natural and human resources) as well as public services
	  (transportation, police, justice...) that the society provides to
	  them, they should be taxed regarding the use they do of natural and
	  human resources in particular about the cost of resource recycling,
	  and for public services in regard of the use they do if it.
	</p>

    <h3>Natural Resources</h3>

    <p align="justify">
      For natural resources, a company will be taxed proportionally to the
      recycling cost of the product they build/transform. This implies that the
      company provides information about the transformation applied to the
      natural resources or already transformed resources used as base of
      their production, in order to estimate the cost of recycling.
    </p>

    <p align="justify" style="margin-left: 5%">
      <u>Risk:</u> rely on suppliers to do the biggest ugly
      part of resource transformation, for that reason, importations should
      also be taxed in regard to the cost of recycling the product will
      have.
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      Following the same principle as VAT, a &quot;RAT&quot; for <b>Recycling Added Tax</b>, could
      address this cost, usually left to the society by bankrupted
      companies. By natural resource, it must also be take into account the
      surface used for buildings and the reference for such tax is the
      recycling cost to get back to pre-human activity status (status the
      land had before the human even have used it): the cost of removing
      all building, concrete, roads, pollution, and so on.
    <p>

    <p align="justify">
      The value of an agricultural field when no chemical  product have
      been used (for example) during decades and soil pollution is absent can be considered
      equivalent (thus maximal) to pre-human activity status. Forests that
      are managed for long-term can also be assimilated to this highest level
      of value as there is no recycling cost: just wait the plant to grow to
      get back to pre-human status equivalent. This is not the case for a ruined building
      as one can wait for plants to grow, once trees will get their maximum
      height the building and the traces of human activities will still be visible,
      and/or will still have measurable consequences on flora and fauna if soil
      pollution occurred, for example.
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      In consequence, a company that recycles resources will get compensated
      accordingly to the cost the society would have taxed a company doing
      the opposite action. For example a company which action is to recycle
      trash will get paid according the difference of value from the trash
      and the resulting recycled product.
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      Adding the recycling cost to product manufacturing should lead companies to
      select the best raw materials and best transformation process that ease
      recycling. And if not, the society will not have to cleanup the mess
      while company just enriched with beautifully ugly products for the
      environment (plastics, ...)
    <p>

    <h3>Human Resources</h3>

    <p align="justify">
      For human resource, recycling means maintaining employability for
      employees by mean of training, and/or role change. What should count
      in this evaluation is not the salary, but the difference of
      employability each employee has when entering the company and when
      leaving it.
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      The state should compute yearly statistics for a meaningful set of role
      categories and provide for each role:
      <ul>
	<li/> The average unemployment duration, referred as <b>UNEMP</b> in the following
	<li/> The average employment duration, referred as <b>EMP</b>
	<li/> The average annual salary, referred <b>SAL</b> in the following
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      We can then define the <b>Employability Ratio</b> (ER) for a role category by:
    <p>

    <p align="center">
      <b>ER(role) =  EMP / (UNEMP + EMP)</b>
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      This is the average fraction of time a person having this role is
      employed
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      The difference of employability when the employee enters and leaves a
      company gives the variation of the fraction of time an employee will
      stay unemployed. The cost to the company is the
      <b>Employability Tax</b> (ET) which is defined by the
      product of Employability ratio variation times the average
      unemployment times duration times the average salary for the role
      employee had:
    </p>

    <p align="center">
      <b>ET = [ ER(entrance role) - ER(exit role) ] *  UNEMP(exit role) * SAL(exit role)</b>
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      This can mean the company will receive money for the ET if the employee
      has increased its employability on the market:
    </p>

    <center>
      <img src="er_increase.png" name="ER increase" align="center" border="0"/>
    </center>

    <p align="justify">
      But of course this also means that if a company does not take care of
      maintaining employability of its employees, it will have to pay a tax
      according to the decrease of ER:
    </p>

    <center>
      <img src="er_decrease.png" name="ER decrease" align="center" border="0"/>
    </center>

    <p align="justify">
      It means a company does not carry the load of unemployment for a given
      employee that leaves the company, but only the degradation of value
      an employee had on the market by staying in the company. And if the
      ER value increased during the time the employee stood in the company,
      this one would be reward for that.
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      But, to avoid a company to artificially change the role of employees
      before firing them and this way avoid paying for the ET, during the
      average duration time of the new role a <b>penalty ER</b>
      is introduced which lead the ET to be the following:
      <ul>
	<li>First the ET reward expressed above should be prorata temporis
	  of the employee time in this new role compared to the
	  average employee duration for that role.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Second we introduce the notion of Penalty ER,
	  which corresponds to the ER the employee had N years before his role
	  change, where N is the duration the employee has spent in its new
	  role (see diagram below). The difference of ER compared to the
	  entrance ER times gives a second ET that is added to the first ET
	  prorata temporis to the complement of the first ET time ratio:
	</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <center>
      <img src="er_role_change_transition.png" name="Penalty ER" align="center" border="0"/>
    </center>

    <p align="justify">
      That way just after the change of role the benefit of the role change is
      little because the time spent in this new role is little (prorata
      temporis). At the same time the Penalty ER is the one the employee
      has in his former role just before changing of role, thus the penalty
      ET is maximum because the time ratio for penalty is also maximum.
      This is as if the employee had left without having changed of role.
      As time passes and as the employee has more experience in this new
      role, the benefit ER increases and the penalty ER decreases both
      because the Penalty ER decreases in value but also because the time
      ratio for it is reduced as time passes. After EMP time in the new
      role, the time ratio for the penalty ET is null and the ET is equal
      to the ET calculated previously only considering the entrance ER and
      the exit ER (see examples below)
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      It is assumed the indemnity provided to unemployed people is
      proportional to the average salary for the role the employee had in
      his previous professional experience (and not linked to its real own
      salary). The cost of unemployment is charged on all salaries of
      active persons, sort of mandatory insurance for unemployment. As a
      consequence the unemployment cost is paid by the citizen only, the
      company pays only the loss of value of their employee when they
      leave, this should lead company to provide training to their people
      that have real value on the market for their employee and also
      promote them when a given job is decreasing.
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      Why not making difference when an employee resign and when he is fired?
      Because it may leave due to pressure from the employer.
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      Why not making difference when an employee resigns for a new job? Because
      it does not change the need for a company to maintaining
      employability. This does not forbid company to contract conditions
      (if conform to law) for the employee to engage for a given period of
      time in the company for the new role.
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      Last the ET should be calculated each year and redeemed or charged to
      companies each year, as if all their employee were leaving at the end
      of year and were arrived at the end of the previous year. This way it
      takes care of company bankruptcy.
    </p>


    <p align="justify">
      <u><b>Example 1:</b></u>
    </p>

    <p align="justify" style="margin-left: 5%">
      Mr Doe has been employed for 10 years in company A always in the same
      role category, which at the time he entered the company had the
      following indicators: UNEMP = 1 year, EMP = 5 years, SAL = 60 k&euro;. After
      these 10 years, Mr Doe leaves or is fired by company A, but the role
      indicators are now: UEMP = 2 years, EMP = 5 years, SAL 50 k&euro;
      <br/>
      The ER at entrance was: 5 / (5 + 1) = 0.83
      <br/>
      The ER at exit is: 5 / (5 + 2) = 0.71
      <br/>
      The ET for enterprise A is: (0.83 - 0.71) * 2 * 50 k&euro; = +12 k&euro;
    </p>

    <p align="justify" style="margin-left: 5%">
      But if the indicator for this role had been better (unemployment duration
      reduced for example) company A would have received money accordingly,
      without having done anything!
    </p>

    <p align="justify" style="margin-left: 5%">
      We see that the unemployment indemnity for the former employee will be
      100 k&euro; in average (for two years), this is not the company that
      pays this amount, company only pays the variation of cost the unemployment
      for this role has between the time the employee has been engaged and the
      time the employee leaves the company.
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      <u><b>Example 2:</b></u>
    </p>

    <p align="justify" style="margin-left: 5%">
      Mr Doe has started at company B as role 1 (UEMP = 1, EMP = 3, SAL = 50
      k&euro;) after 5 years, role 1 indicators are (UEMP = 2, EMP = 3, SAL =
      45 k&euro;) at that time company B to avoid the corresponding ET cost
      decides to promote Mr Doe to role 2 with a salary of 50 k&euro; (no
      salary change) eventually providing him an adapted training for this new
      role . After 6 years in this role 2, which we assume has not changed
      significantly over years (UEMP = 1, EMP = 6, SAL = 70 k&euro;) Mr Doe
      resigned for another company.
      <br/>
      The ER at entrance was: 3 / (3 + 1) = 0.75
      <br/>
      The ER at exit is:  6 / (6 + 1) = 0.85
    </p>

    <p align="justify" style="margin-left: 5%">
      As Mr. Doe has had an experience duration greater or equal the EMP in
      his last role (6 years), the penalty ER is ignored and the company is
      rewarded the following ET:
      <br/>
      ET = (0.75 - 0.85) * 1 * 70 k&euro$ = -7 k&euro;
    </p>

    <p align="justify" style="margin-left: 5%">
      But if Mr Doe had left or was fired after one year instead of 6, the
      penalty ER would have played:
      <br/>
      Penalty ER = 3/(3 + 2) = 0.6
      <br/>
      The ET would have been:
      <br/>
      ET = ET1 + ET2
      <br/>
      ET1 = (0.75 - 0.85) * 1 * 70 k&euro; * 1/6 = -1,16 k&euro;

      Where from the total ET = +10 k&euro;
    </p>

    <p align="justify" style="margin-left: 5%">
      Company B would have to pay 10 k&euro; for the Employability Tax. This mechanism
      avoid the company to try reducing the ET by changing the role
      category of employee just before firing them. The fact that Mr Doe only
      stood one year while the average employment duration is 6 years also means
      this experience at role 2 is too short to have a complete value and Mr. Doe
      may experiment difficulties being engaged under this role in the future.
    </p>


    <h3>Costs of Risks</h3>
    <p align="justify">
      If an employee dies due to risk inherent to the role he has or due to
      lack of security addressed by the company, this one will have to
      redeem the heirs to the last salary the employee had for the time
      remaining to his retirement. Any membership fee for retirement shall
      be performed as if the person was still alive and would provide a
      retired amount up to the average life expectancy for the role the
      employee had. Proving the origin of the injuries would be a decision
      done by the Justice (nothing automatic here are their are ways to abuse
      the system by employee as well as employers)
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      For that Reason Company should have insurance for any risk they can bring
      to the resources, whether human or natural. In particular an
      Industrial company that manipulate dangerous chemical substance that
      could explode or pollute the grounds should contract an insurance in
      regard to this risks and this way be able to fix and compensate any
      catastrophe which could be generated by its activity.
    </p>

    <h3>Use of public Services</h3>

    <p align="justify">
      Companies should also be taxed in regard to their use of
      transportation infrastructure, common and public services, as well as
      for regalian services. If for the first ones the tax can be
      proportional to the use (transportation, postal services when
      publicly owned...) care should be taken for the access to Justice to
      be possible even for little or emerging companies. The tax could be
      for example indexed on the turnover that each company had the
      previous year (no tax for the first year of exercise of a company).
      Note that losing a pursuit does not mean having no cost for such
      small companies. In other words, each company will have to pay a tax
      for justice which amount will depend on their turnover whatever they
      are suing or not.
    </p>

    <h3>Controlling system</h3>

    <p align="justify">
      The cost of controlling (real use of natural and human resource, adequate
      risks insurance subscribed and proper declaration of public services
      usage) must be carried by the companies' activities. This cost can
      be balanced between companies taking into account each company's
      turnover, here again. The fine amount in case of infraction should be
      chose high enough to compensate the lack of risk to be caught by the
      controlling system. Less tax implies less means for the controlling system
      resources, thus the fine amount in case of fraud must be increased in
      consequence for dissuasion: in other words, the product of (the fine
      amount) x (the frequency of controls or difficulty to be caught) must be constant.
    </p>

    <h1>Constitution</h1>

    <p align="justify">
      Once an idea has been retained but before a minister get selected, it must
      be validated for conformance with the constitution. A constitutional council
      is needed for that and can
      be solicited by the president of the executive power, president of
      the justice power and by some associations recognized of social interest
      (like association acting against corruption, for human rights...).
      </p>

    <p align="justify">
      The constitutional council can also give a status without external
      solicitation. In case of rejection of an idea, the constitutional
      council must justify its decision based on the constitution.
      If an idea is rejected by this council this will lead it
      to the same fate as if it was not elected.
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      The definition, of the constitution is outside the scope of GBI,
      though one could allow the GBI system to add, modify or remove
      rules of the constitution, it should be done with some additional
      validation process outside the perimeter of this proposal (higher ratio
      of voter for this constitutional idea...)
    </p>

    <h1>Executive Power - President Role and interaction</h1>

    <p align="justify">
      As stated in introduction, the GBI in addition to be a complete
      legislative power is also a partial executive power that needs to be
      completed by a presidential role as of today in many democracies
      (directly or indirectly elected by people). The frontier between
      actions that the president can take and those that he cannot take
      alone should be defined precisely and is out of the scope of this
      proposal. However, some decision the president has the power to take
      alone could still have the form of a <b>presidential idea</b> with
      maybe smaller quorum of elector necessary for its adoption (relative
      majority of voter for example, with a amount of votes corresponding to
      at least 30 % registered electors). Also a dedicated budget could be
      defined in advanced for such situation and needed actions. Such idea
      will be implemented the same as other ideas: by candidate selection not
      by the president or by its cabinet.
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      In another hand some actions and responsibilities should not be under
      the hand of the GBI system like (nuclear power, weapon use,
      war, etc.) and would be taken without passing through the GBI process.
    </p>


    <h1>Execution Conflicts</h1>

    <p align="justify">
      It may arise that two elected ideas enter in conflict. For example, a
      first elected idea would tends to increase security of car drivers in
      case of accident by introducing a geolocation automated devices in
      vehicles that would detect the occurrence of an accident and trigger
      emergency alert, while another elected idea (possibly already
      completed) would for example control the personal information
      collected from people including their geolocation all along the time.
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      For that reason a set of prime ministers has to be selected (randomly
      from a list of candidates and for a fixed duration) to arbitrate between
      ideas and define the frontier between ideas when two or more collide.
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      Instead of one single person, having an odd number of prime ministers
      randomly selected in a list of candidates (same criteria as for
      minister to postulate to this role) would lead to reduce the risk of
      arbitrary decision.
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      The prime ministers action should only take place when a minister claims
      a conflict against another rule. They should modify each idea
      perimeter in order for the conflict to disappear. Only 3 prime
      minister will be randomly selected to arbitrate a conflict at a time.
      But a broader set of prime-minister can be selected in regard to the
      expected load of arbitration they will have to address.
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      During prime-minister resolution conflict, concerned ideas are suspended,
      this means their time span is extended, but their budget stays the
      same.
    </p>

    <p align="justify" style="margin-left: 5%">
      <u><b>Risk:</b></u> There is the risk a party provides under his
      master super-idea a set of useless ideas that could be used to
      trigger a conflict with other ideas that they are against. This could
      undermine idea with little compensation budget due to the fact the
      minister would not be compensated during the conflict resolution.
    </p>

    <h1>Random selection</h1>


    <p align="justify">
      As described above, minister, sensors and prime-ministers would be
      randomly chosen from a list of candidates. We also saw that
      postulating to a role has some constraints:

      <ul>
	<li>
	  one cannot postulate to a minister role, if it has even been
	  condemned for corruption
	</li>
	<li>
	  one cannot postulate to the role of censor if it has been
	  judged three time for censorship abuse
	</li>
	<li>
	  one cannot postulate to the role of prime-minister if it has
	  been deprived of his rights of elector, condemned for
	  corruption or for censorship abuse.
	</li>
      </ul>
      For all candidate roles, we could also add some constraint
      like to not be in prison, and so on.
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      Now we should also valuable successful role execution, by mean
      of weights. Random selection could be weighted in the following
      manner:
      <ul>
	<li>
	  A minister that has successfully implemented an
	  idea (and this introduce the notion of notation at the end of idea
	  execution by the electors that voted for that idea), could have his
	  weight multiplied by the mark he would have received (using 1 as
	  initial weight). This will lead him more chance to
	  implement another idea if he postulate for a new minister role in
	  the future (in the other way, the mark of a minister condemned for
	  corruption would become zero, forbidding any further selection)
	</li>
	<li>
	  A censor that could demonstrate the corruption or
	  result falsification of a minister and lead him condemned could have
	  his weight multiplied by 10.
	</li>
	<li>
	  A censor that would have be condemned for
	  censorship abuse would have its weight divided by 5 for each such
	  sentence received (up to 3 in his life).
	</li>
	<li>
	  But as it is difficult to validate the way a
	  prime minister has performed, there would not be weight for this
	  candidate role.
	</li>
	If in a candidate list a first candidate has a weight of 10 and a
	second 	has a weight of 1 the probability for this later to be
	selected would 	be 1/11 and for the first 10/11. Chances is that the
	list of	candidate would be much greater, if not the weighting value
	could be revised.
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      Doing that way, leverages candidates with good skills for a given role.
      Professional politician could well emerge but should be sanctioned
      the same as newcomers and be banned forever from the role if they
      failed (condemned for corruption, abuse...) even if their weight
      was very high over time.
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      Any candidate for an election as well as any citizen should be able
      to assist to the selection process. It could even be broadcasted to
      public media. Each selection  must be performed under the control of a bailiff
      using a mechanical machine (not computer science based here, as there
      is no way to control from the outside the fairness of the random
      selection). This requires physical presence of the bailiff to assist to the random
      selection and a set of official mecanical machines, controlled regularly for they
      fairness (see loto system for example). There could be every day a batch
      of candidate selections for their corresponding set of ideas, maybe even
      several bailiff in parallel doing that selection or different sets of ideas.
      Public announcements would be done some days before about the concerned selections,
      in order for people to be able to control its execution flow.
      In particular the candidates could be notified of their date/time of selection.
    </p>

    <h1>Return to civil life</h1>

    <p align="justify">
      Care must be taken for ministers once they have completed their
      idea to be reinserted into civil life. For that reason during a time
      proportional to the idea they has achieved with success (thus, this
      does not concern condemned ministers), they will benefit of a reserve
      corresponding to twice the lowest legal salary times the duration of
      their work as minister (this reserve is independent from the idea
      compensation budget and idea’s global budget) and multiplied by the mark
      they would receive at the end of execution in such a way an average
      performance would be rewarded the lowest legal salary while the highest
      performance would be rewarded twice the lowest salary.
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      This reserve can be used by the former minister at his discretion
      but he will never get more than twice the minimum legal salary per
      month. The goal is both to face unemployment and motivate the citizen
      to candidate and succeed in their role of minister.
    </p>

    <p align="justify" style="margin-left: 5%">
      <u><b>Risk:</b></u> a balance has to be defined between the level
      of mean provided to get back to civil life and avoiding people
      postulating to this role just for the money they will have during
      the role and the compensation they will have after to carry their
      return to civil life. Care must also be taken for the global cost
      of this feature as there may be a lot of minister in a given period
      of time...
    </p>


    <p align="justify">
      Other member of the ministerial cabinet are not concerned by such
      mechanism as they were not chosen randomly, but for their skills. As
      such they did not had to abandon their work and can add this experience
      as expert or specialist on their resume. Their experience as expert for
      a member of the ministerial cabinet is the continuity of their day to
      day work and if they were successful they would have more chance than
      before to find a job, including a new role of expert in another
      ministerial cabinet.
    </p>

    <h1>Political Party</h1>

    <p align="justify">
      By political party we mean here any group of persons sharing a common
      view and/or ideology, this may well be also a philosophical group,
      or any common group of interest or company. Such entity can register a
      &quot;<b>tag</b>&quot;
      to the GBI system which they will be allowed to add to any existing
      idea, whatever is their author. <b>Tags can be either positive or negative</b>,
      meaning either that the corresponding political party approves or
      rejects such idea. Of course such political party would tag positively
      the ideas they submit with their own tag, but some of their super
      idea might well rely on already existing ideas and it would not make
      sense to duplicate an idea as it would reduce its chance to be
      elected. Idea borrowing that way is thus strongly encouraged by
      listing them as sub-idea of a super-idea or by adding tag to it to
      flag them to electors as conform to the ideology of the political party.
      An idea can thus receive
      several tags from several political parties. The tagging of an idea
      requires authentication to avoid tag usurpation. A negative tag
      can be set instead to an idea that is rejected by a given party.
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      For elector, such tag system may help validate the impact and consequence
      of an idea if they trusted the group of person that own the tag
      (association, political party, philosophical community, and so on).
      This is also the way a political party could give directive to its
      members. An elector could of course rely on several tags and vote for
      idea that match positive tags of a list of parties unless it also matches
      negative tags of another set of political parties.
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      We could also imagine a system where elector can subscribe to a given
      set of tags define a maximum budget and have the system voting for
      the ideas having at least one of the selected tags (and not negative
      tags from another defined set of tags) when its cost
      is below an elector defined amount and while the global elector defined
      budget has not been exhausted.
    </p>

    <p align="justify" style="margin-left: 5%">
      <u><b>Risk:</b></u> This mechanism may lead some elector to completely
      delegate their voice and not becoming concerned anymore in the future
      of the country, just complaining about what they have in their plate,
      or rather what they have not in their own plate, ignoring the rest of
      the society. However they will vote for idea, thus in a way the
      would participate in the decision process of their country.
    </p>

    <h1>Idea submitter consideration</h1>

    <p align="justify">
      It could be added as an option that idea submitter get rewarded when an
      idea they submitted has been elected. The reward could be financial
      and visible as such in the total cost of the idea. This amount could
      even be defined by the idea submitter inside a limit range fraction
      of the total budget of the idea. At least the cost of the idea submission
      should be return to the submitter if this idea has been elected.
    </p>

    <h1>Conclusion</h1>

    <p align="justify">
      The objective of such political decision system defining a new legislative
      system and partially redefining the executive system is to involve people closer to
      the decision process and keeping a eye on the way it is executed.
      There is many options (automatic tag voting) that can let people just
      live they political life as of today, but at least for more concerned
      citizen, there is room to propose, room to choose, room to control
      and room to act, while traditional political party would still have their
      place in that system.
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      Having people interested in the life of their country, in their own
      future would make more difficult for a lobby to pass some laws for the
      advantage of a very minority or not being hold as responsible for the
      pollution or injuries they caused. If all eyes look at a basket of gold,
      thieves have to wait for a distracting event to have a chance to grab unnoticed some
      pieces of the fortune. However if nobody looks at the basket, this
      one will become empty very soon and nobody will even have an idea of
      who were the thieves where the went with our fortune, this is the situation
      we can have today in politics when people do not get concerned by the politician
      actions.
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      My strongest hope is that such political system or another leads as soon
      as possible for decisions to be taken and action to be performed in regard
      to the global warming and more generally for the general interest of the
      civilization not only for the one of a rich subset of people. The Drake
      equation mention a lot a factor that lead to estimate the number of
      extraterrestrial civilization we should be able to communicate with, but
      it can also be applied to our own civilization. in particular, its last
      factor, &quot;L&quot;, defines the civilization lifetime and this is the
      one we are playing  with now. Unfortunately if we do not take action now
      (if we just negate the precautionary principle, for example),
      this value for our civilization might well be very very
      short. But after all, maybe our civilization is not adapted to surviving and
      will perish by natural selection?

    <h1>Annexes</h1>
    <h2>Voting System Example</h2>

    <p align="justify">
      GBI implies frequent election for many submitted ideas,
      relying on new technology is necessary to reduce cost for the society
      and time for the citizen. However care must be taken to provide vote
      privacy and control. The following is a proposal of system that is in
      fact independent on the GBI but is provided just to illustrate
      the feasibility of the frequent voting requirements of GBI.
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      For that purpose two independent organism can be defined:
      <ul>
	<li>
	  <b>Elector Identity Bureau</b> - EIB, which registers electors
	  and authenticate them
	</li>
	<li>
	  <b>Virtual Assembly</b> - VA which contains exposed and adopted
	  ideas, search engine and voting system.
	</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>EIB</h3>

    <p align="justify">
      This bureau can be a centralized or distributed organism, each city for
      example registering its citizen based on official passport or ID card
      and a legal register of person banned from the GBI system for
      corruption or other justified reasons. Its first role is to attribute
      an <b>Elector ID</b> to each electors. An Elector ID a public number with
      integrated checksum (to detect typo error). An Elector is also given
      a secret pin/password/passphrase, which the elector is the only one to know
      (like PIN for sim cards, credit cards, and the like). EIB may renew
      ID from time to time and will communicate the new ID by postal letter
      as of today or ciphered emails if the elector has registered a GPG
      key and email to the EIB portal.
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      EIB provides an SSL portal to the electors on Internet that has several
      purposes:
      <ul>
	<li>
	  Register a GPG public key and email (after having authenticated
	  with the Elector ID)
	</li>
	<li>
	  Hide the IP address of the elector terminal to the VA, hide the
	  identity of the elector to the VA
	</li>
	<li/> Provide a single sign on for the VA
	<li/> Place to report fraud about Elector ID usage
      </ul>
      The EIB is thus the only organism having the correspondence between an
      Elector ID at a given time and the elector person it has been assigned
      to at that time. In particular the VA does only know the Elector ID and
      has no information about the Elector itself.
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      A terminal used for voting by an elector (laptop, smartphone,
      tablet...), when connecting to the VA, has to use the EIB portal as web
      proxy. The VA portal must *not* be accessible directly from Internet,
      but a page of information should be telling how to configure the Elector
      terminal to vote in total privacy. VA access is ciphered by SSL thus
      EIB has no way to know about the vote done by the elector when the
      communication is established from the terminal to VA through the EIB
      Proxy. At initial connection and for a limited time, the Elector
      first authenticate to the EIB proxy which generates a token the
      terminal will use during the session with VA. The VA will receive
      this token and interrogate the EIB on its validity and Elector
      ID correspondence).
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      When the user will perform a vote on the VA, the VA will provide
      the token and Elector ID to the EIB, which will validate the
      authenticity of the Elector to the VA. The fact the session passes
      through the EIB proxy hides from the VA the original IP address and
      enforce anonymization of Electors to the VA.
    </p>

    <h3>VA</h3>

    <p align="justify">
      The Virtual Assembly is the place where is gathered and registered the
      ideas. This registration and payment is done without interacting with
      the EIB, submitter must be publicly identified and be registered.
      This is the <b>VA idea submitter portal</b>
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      The VA is also the place where --- through the EIB proxy and with EIB
      authentication --- votes take place. Once authenticated to the
      <b>VA voter portal</b> each elector has a view of exposed ideas
      including the ones he has already voted for (or explicitly against),
      He can also see the ideas that are currently executed (having
      information about minister and ministerial cabinet, sensors and
      budget used, the action status report provided by the minister, and
      so on), and has the possibility for the VA voter portal do not
      display (forgets) the ideas he has voted for or against (he can
      reactivate it afterward but won’t see votes done before that time).
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      Elector should have the ability to search ideas by keywords, by end of
      exposing date (date at which nobody can vote for it and its vote
      count is evaluated), by authors, by tags and combination of those
      filters. The possibility to browse ideas up and down in a tree of
      super-idea and sub-ideas should also be necessary (when a super-idea
      contains sub-ideas the Elector rejected, he may want to vote
      manually for some other sub-idea except that one.
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      Of course if an Elector has voted against an idea, some color code
      should show that status for such ideas but also for the super ideas
      that due to that vote cannot be voted for. Same thing when voting for
      a super-idea all sub-idea should have color code telling the Elector
      has voted for implicitly. View should also allow an Elector to see
      not yet voted ideas only, voted for ideas or voted against ideas.
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      A set of tags and their value (positive/negative) could be combined
      to define color code of idea votable for the elector and non votable for the
      elector (not conform to the set of tags the elector has defined).
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      The VA voter portal is only accessible through the EIB proxy, to hide
      IP source and enforce anonymization of the voter. Once an idea has been
      voted for, some statistics about the number of votes are sent back to
      the EIB for control:
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      When a voter votes for an idea, EIB get solicited for Elector
      authentication and can count the number of votes a given Elector has
      done but EIB cannot know for which idea the elector has voted.
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      EIB can thus during a given period of time compare the total number of
      votes summing the number of votes per electors with the total number
      of votes received from VA statistics by summing the amount of voter
      for each idea that has been voted for during that time. This should
      make fraud a bit more difficult.
    </p>

    <h3>Securing Elector Terminals</h3>

    <p align="justify">
      The terminal or user device has to be secured. Choice must be left to
      the elector to define the security of his terminal by itself or to rely
      on vendor terminal certified as secure by the EIB or even provided by
      EIB. EIB should also provide good practice for a secure Election
      process, including social engineering menace and all that goes with
      (phising, etc.)
    </p>

    <p align="justify" style="margin-left: 5%">
      Risk: is that EIB by mean of such terminal
      provided by itself get information of the votes done by the elector
      and even modifies votes done without the elector noticing.
    </p>

    <h2>Structural Costs</h2>

    <p align="justify">
      The cost of such legislative system (idea election) and executive system
      (minister, censors and prime-minister) is contained in the budget of
      the elected idea. This is thus the electors that define their level
      of tax and accordingly their level of services. Majority being the
      decision maker, we should reduce the case where a small subset of the
      population (a lobby or a company) passes laws that only benefit to
      this minority.
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      Remains for the state some structural costs:
      <ul>
	<li/>All regalian services, as of today
	<li/>Constitutional council members, as of today
	<li>
	  Prime ministers, which are not compensated from
	  an elected idea as they have to arbitrate perimeters and priorities
	  between them, no representation role, less budget need but more
	  people
	</li>
	<li>
	  The voting and idea submission system (and its
	  controlling entity)
	</li>
	<li>
	  The candidate selection system (and its controlling entity)
	</li>
	<li>
	  A super censorship that may be elected by the
	  people to control the censors not to have collusion with the
	  minister they share an idea with.
	</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Idea Fields</h2>
