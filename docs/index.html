    <title>Democracy 2.0 - Government By Ideas</title>

  <body>
    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      If you are tired of voting for a candidate and then to realize that once elected
      that he/she does not hold the promises and engagements he/she defended
      during the campaign, the following political system might interest you.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      To avoid such pitfall, we should thus not elect persons, but just the
      &quot;ideas&quot;  the candidates pretend they would defend. The following is
      a proposal of such system and as a proposal is presented for feedback,
      comments and adaptations, in order to be improved.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      For brevity the political system hereafter described will be
      referred as <b>Government By Ideas</b> or in short <b>GBI</b>.
    </p>

    <h1>About the Author</h1>
    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      The author is a simple French citizen, employee
      in the private sector and not linked with any political party nor
      part of any lobby.
    </p>

    <h1>Concept</h1>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      GBI aim is to provide an enhancement to democracy that puts
      the people closer to decisions having them involved in more varied manners and more frequently than one vote every 4 or 5 years. As a side effect GBI should avoiding lobbies deciding in secret in the
      place of citizens, it should also lead the fight against corruption, placing
      the general interest of the state at the center of the government
      actions. Though lobbies have a place in this political system beside
      policical parties, associations, corporations and any other
      subset of citizen whatever is its form sharing some common interests.
    </p>

    <h1>Scope</h1>
    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      GBI is not a substitute for justice, for police, for education,
      for healthcare, nor any other regalian services.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      GBI's target is to have laws modified, created
      and withdrawn in order to adapt them to new realities a country is
      facing. It thus takes the role of a <b>legislative authority</b> and also
      partially of an <b>executive authority</b>. But GBI has not the role
      to enforce laws, which stays in the hands of police and justice.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      As shortly explained previously, in addition to be a legislative
      authority, GBI is <b>partial an executive authority</b>. Why partial? Because GBI decision process
      need time and is not adapted to actions that must be taken quickly
      like defense, war, fight against terrorism and any other new situation
      that may arise putting the country at risk *and* needing fast decision.
      But action that engages the country regarding other countries (cooperation treaties,
      public foreign affairs) must not be excluded from GBI decision system.
      For that reason this is only a <b>partial executive power</b> where a
      president function is still needed and will have to be elected as per
      democracy usage.
    </p>


    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left: 5%">
      <u>Risk:</u> risk is that such president or a group of
      person behind him take over the GBI by invoking imminent danger
      (like mass destruction weapons in another country)
      to take action that else would be under the scope of GBI
    </p>

    <h1>Elections Process</h1>
    <h2>Ideas election</h2>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      GBI means to not elect candidates but to elect ideas. Ideas have
      first to be defined and presented. This first step is open to any
      voter without restriction, this is the idea not its author that
      matters at this step. We will see below the difference between an
      voter and a citizen.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      But to avoid the system to be overloaded under ideas, each submission
      should cost a symbolic fixed amount of money plus an amount
      proportional to the revenue of the submitter. Such amount should
      allow any working citizen even the ones with the smallest legal
      revenue to pay the submission of one idea per year and still having
      enough money to satisfy the minimum level of expenses required to
      live with dignity (the exact amount of this fee is out of the scope of this document).
      The number of idea a person can present per year
      should probably not to be limited as we might have very good an fruitful contributors as well
      also as sober but less poor ones. But we will see that useless or inadapted ideas
      will just be ignored GBI process and will not cost much resource to anyone except its author.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      Once an idea has been submitted to the system it receives an <u>Idea ID</u> that
      identifies it and will be used to refer to it in particular for voting.<b>An idea will be retained if a majority of voter approves it</b>. Abstention is considered the same as
      rejecting an idea, but explicitly voting against an idea is possible
      and has some interest which will be detailed later. In consequence explicitly
      voting for a given idea shall not be mandatory.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left: 5%">
      <u>Risk:</u> here the risk is that no idea would get
      enough vote for the country to pass new laws in order to adapt to new
      needs. This is however a good mean to lead people to be concerned by
      the life of their country for their problems to get solved. To be
      representative and thus valid, an idea cannot be adopted if it has not been approved
      by at least half of the voters<u>this clause is fundamental for GBI</u>.
      Note that we speak about voters not citizens, how a citizen can become an voter
      is described below.

    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      This way, limiting the number of idea per person and per time is not necessary
      as they will just be ignored if their submitter has either not put the
      means to make it known, understood and accepted, or if the submitted
      idea is just silly, useless, not interesting. No effort will be needed
      to have refused (or ignored) ideas purged from the GBI system.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      The delay between voting and idea submission, is the time slice during which
      the idea is exposed to debate, we will designate this period by <b>exposure time</b>.
    This is the duty and responsibility of the ideas's author to define the proper exposure time
    duration when he will submit his idea to the system. He will have to choose it in a way to maximize
      the number of votes and still not delay the idea too much in the future
      for it can be taken by voters as a solution to the <u>current</u> problems.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      This is thus the duty of an idea submitter to make it known, understood,
      voted for and accepted. All mean are possible for that, including
      advertisement, social networks, emails... Debates could take place
      anywhere, usenet newsgroups, public meetings, emails, social media,
      whatever, but always clearly indicating the idea ID's they debate about,
      compare, valuate, promote or criticize. However unfair
      communication means that do not allow anyone to present its idea (TV
      broadcast, newspaper... in particular when privately owned), should
      not be allowed to mention exposed ideas or votable ideas and their responsible should be
      fined in case
      they would refer directly (Idea ID) or indirectly (title, tag,
      keywords) to an idea. The amount of the fine should be double at each recurrence.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left: 5%">
      <u>Risk:</u>  the reason why to forbid unfair
      communication means to promote ideas takes it root in the will to reduce the risk of citizen
      brain washing by owners of such communication
      means (TV, newspaper...), omitting to mention alternatives to ideas not in phase
      with their own ideology. This reason behind that is to reduce the <u>hidden</u> scope a lobby can
      have to influence voter's voting and thus decisions taken for the country, when it is the owner
      of such communcation mean and defines the editorial line.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      Once the exposition delay has been passed, the voting phase starts at the end of which the idea
      either adopted (if it has a majority of votes) or rejected. There is no need to synchronize
      the time and date of votes between different ideas, we could speak about continuous voting.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left: 5%">
      <u>Risk:</u> the strongest risk here is that GBI
      strongly need computer science based systems. Especially for voting,
      unlike physical vote where any citizen can check that there is no
      fraud in each vote center, and seen the publicly available result of
      each vote center checking that the result of its vote center is correctly reported and that the global vote is true (but how many citizen
      take the time to do that today?). Using computer science means
      completely removing the citizen control against fraud. A voting system
      is proposed in annex that leverage Internet access and tend to
      minimize if not avoiding fraud.
    </p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
  We could also consider to not distinguish the exposure time from the voting time,
  but this would imply to allow any voter to change is mind and thus of vote before the
  end of the common period of exposure and voting, whil still preserving the voting secrecy.
  (An example of system that allows such freedom is described in annex)
</p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      It could also be defined that when the time remaining before end of vote
      is only a third of the total exposition time (for example), voters
      could not change their vote anymore, only voter not having yet
      voted could add their voice to or against the concerned idea.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      Having the information of explicites votes for or against each ideas currently available
      for voting could be a possible option, it will however become necessary for amendments
      (see below). In addition, providing a list of the
      most voted idea still in voting phase (nothing says whether votes are favorable
      or not) could be interesting to compensate the 50 % minimum votes an idea has to obtain to be
      accepted.
    </p>

    <h2>Super-Ideas</h2>
    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      An idea can be dependent on another one. Each idea will thus have a
      dependency list (eventually void), but cyclic dependency (idea A
      depends on idea B which itself depends on idea A) cannot be possible
      due to the fact an idea is identified at the time it is registered and then
      becomes immutable, thus it can only depend on ideas that existed at the time
      it had been registered.
      We will designate by super-idea any such idea that relies on at
      least one other idea. In the same way, we will designate an leaf-idea, an idea
      that does not depend on any other idea.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      A new idea could thus list a set of other existing ideas (by their
      idea's ID) and voting for it will imply voting for all ideas it
      depends on. Of course an elector could not vote for an idea if this
      one has in its dependency list an idea the voter has already
      explicitly voted against. However the elector can still vote for any
      other idea presented in the dependency list of this super-idea, but
      not for the super-idea itself. This way an elector could vote against
      some ideas (that he find unacceptable) and see what's left to vote for.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      A super-idea could also be listed in the dependency list of another
      idea. This way, a given idea could be referred in the dependency list
      of many other ideas, directly or indirectly, making a tree of ideas.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      In addition to that, an idea could thus be referred by several different
      super idea trees making common branches between these trees.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      We could imagine political party providing their own super-ideas and their
      set of dependent ideas. We could also imagine some other
      political party borrowing some sub-ideas from a first party by adding
      them in the dependency list of their master super-idea (directly or
      not). Though any citizen could decide to vote for any leaf-idea
      whatever is the party or citizen it has been submitted by, as well as
      voting for super-ideas that have this leaf-idea in their dependency list,
      leading the ideas common to different political party to have more
      chance to be elected.
    </p>

    <h2>Debates and amendments</h2>

    <h3>Debates</h3>
    <p style="text-align:justify;">

    <h2>Minister</h2>
    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      Now that an idea has been retained thanks to the idea election process
      described above, a person has to be selected (not elected, but
      randomly chosen - see chapter for that topic) to implement it. Any
      people that has the right to vote and has not been condemned for
      corruption in their live can postulate to execute a given idea. The selected
      candidate will be called the minister for this idea. A person cannot
      be minister for two different ideas at the same time. But a person
      can be minister in his life as many times as he has postulated and has
      been selected.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      The role of the minister is be to implement the idea, that's it to
      define all the necessary for this idea to become applicable in the
      perimeter described by this idea submitter. He will also have the
      duty to regularly report about his actions: what has been done so far,
      what stays to be done, what are the problems met today to go forward,
      and so on. The frequency of these status report are defined at the submission time
      of the idea by its author.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      If a super-idea has been elected, a minister for this super-idea will
      have the duty to implement the whole tree of dependent ideas (see
      Ministerial Cabinet below). There will not be minister selection for
      any of the child idea of this super-idea.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      However if two elected super-ideas have the same idea in their
      dependency list, or depend on the same branch of ideas (a common branch
      of ideas between two elected trees), this common sub-idea
      or common branch of ideas they depend on will have a dedicated minister
      and will be removed from the responsibility of the each super-idea ministers.
      If any such super-idea need first such sub-idea or sub-branch to be
      implemented in order to start, the minister could decide to postpone its
      execution, the same way as he can decide to temporarily suspend its execution,
      and decide of of its end (successful or failed). In any case, he will have to justify his
      decision as defined by the idea submitter at least during the planned
      action status reports.
    </p>

    <h2>Censors</h2>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      In parallel to minister candidates, censors have to be selected
      (randomly chosen from the list of censor candidates) for a given idea
      to control that the actions status provided by the minister are true
      and sincere in regard to actions effectively performed, encontered
      constraints, realized objectives,and so on.
      Censor will be able to trigger Justice if there is significant
      difference between actions status report done by the minister and
      reality of facts, or if the action performed would be outside the
      perimeter of the original idea. A minister could be this way revoked
      and condemned. He would not be allowed anymore to postulate for a
      role of minister for the rest of his life. If the judgment does not
      retain the minister to be guilty, the censor should not be
      prosecuted, unless he triggered justice without strong enough
      reasons to do so. In that case he may be condemned for censorship abuse. A
      censor could be condemned up to three time for abuse in his life
      (being censor for the same idea or for another one), after that he
      won't be able to be selected as censor for the rest of his life.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left: 5%">
      <u><b>Risk:</b></u> if censors do not feel free to investigate and
      if necessary, to trigger the Justice, the risk is that this role will serve
      no purpose. However a mechanism must exist to prevent abuse. The fact
      the censor is randomly chosen for a given idea reduces the risk but does not
      remove it completely that a censor considers its role more in regard to
      the selected minister person rather than in regard to the action he performs
      (opposite/different political party or human conflict), or worse in regard to the nature
      of the idea itself (idea the censor does not like would receive a lot of
      "investigations" against the minister, or at the opposite, an idea the censor approves
      would receive little or no control for its execution...).
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      If a super-idea has been elected, there will not be a super-censors, but
      as many censor as there is ideas and sub-ideas. This rule will make sense with
      minister cabinet described below. The censorship resource must not be reduced
      for the level of control to be independent from the super-idea hierarchy and
      selected minister(s) that implement them.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left: 5%">
      <b><u>Note:</u></b> An alternative to having a censor per idea is to define
      professionals/officials independent from the number of ideas.
      The history showed that such public human resources tend to
      be reduced over time in the expenses reduction plans. The consequences
      would be a lack of control on the execution of elected idea and probably
      the same drawback as current system, where a (s)elected person does not
      execute the expected actions (implementing another idea than the one
      voters have decided).
    </p>

    <h2>Voter versus Citizen</h2>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      During discussions on GBI, some underlined that many people today (probably the majority
      of voter) are and will never fill concerned by the political activity of their country. This
      would make the corum of 50% an idea should have to be elected difficult or
      impossible to reach.
      To cope with this, we have to distinguish citizens from voters. For a citizen to become
      a voter several points should be necessary:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Will expression to become a voter by actively regitering as voter to an adhoc state organism</li>
      <li>the payment of a small fee at registration time (no more than 1/1000 of the minimum legal</li>
      salary, for example),
    </ul>
    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      The only cause of refuse that a citizen could be opposed could be the same
      reasons an citizen today cannot become a voter (age, conviction for corruption,...).
    </p>
    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      Once a citizen has registered as voter, he will have the right to vote but also
      the duty to be an active elector. This means to perform a minimum number
      of actions per registration period (1 year for example) not to become forfeited
      of his voting right an losing the status of voter.
      Only voter would have the right to
      vote, propose idea or postulate for a role. If losing this right, a citizen could
      register again paying a majorated fee (twice the fee of what was payed at the previous registration,
      for example). The actions that could count a citizen as
      an active voter and thus that would avoid him to be forfeited of his voting right,
      could be of course the fact to vote for or against an idea, the fact to be candidate
      for a role of minister, the fact of being part of the ministerial cabinet, being president,
      having proposed an idea that have been retained, and so on. If a citizen only votes, then
      the minimum number of votes must be based on what a working citizen can reasonably do on his
      personal time, like voting for at least 100 ideas per month. Which means for
      example, voting for a super-idea that depends on 99 other idea or subscribing
      to a "tag" (see political party below) which associated organism proceeds to the
      tagging of at least 100 ideas per month). Of course, if a voter is unable to vote
      for health reasons of force majeure and can justify is situation for a give period
      of time, the minimum number of required votes to stay an elector will be reduced pro
      rata temporis.
    </p>

    <h1>What must contain an Idea</h1>

    An idea is not just an idea, it must define means that will be provided
    to implement it

    <h2>Objective</h2>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      The objective describes the idea by itself. For example &quot;<i>reduce the maximum
      authorized speed for motorized vehicles to 110 km/h on motorways</i>&quot; is
      an objective. However this ideas implies defining penalties to driver
      that would be caught above the speed, provide means to indicate the
      maximum speed, measure the impact of the speed reduction on
      pollution, people health, economy and so on.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      The objective of a super-idea must be coherent with its child ideas.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left: 5%">
      <u>Risk:</u> one person or an organism could hide some ideas
      in the dependency tree of ideas a super-idea can have, that implement the opposite of the
      super-idea itslef, leading people to be trumped.  A penalty system against
      idea submitter would be difficult to be defined and easy to workaround by the coordination of
      several persons. Though the fact the idea submitter
      and the minister are different persons should reduce such risk of abuse. In
      such occurrence if the minister can demonstrate that the super-idea he has
      to implement lists ideas that lead to the opposite action of the
      super-idea, he could be granted to not implement this sub-idea. The minister
      will issue a <i>idea extension</i> (see below) to redefine the perimeter of
      the super idea explaining why he wants to remove certain sub-idea(s).
      The voters for this idea will be notified of this idea extension
      and will have to vote for or against this extension, as well as those that explicitly voted
      against the super-idea. However voter that abstained would not get the right to participate to
      this idea extension.
    </p>

    <h2>Time span</h2>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      An idea must define a maximum duration of execution, it must also define
      the frequency of action status reports the minister would have to
      provide. Once the maximum duration has passed the minister ends his role
      whatever is the status of the idea, unless he has proposed an idea extension that has been
      accepted and that contains a increase of the idea duration. After that time the implementation
      evaluation process starts.
    </p>

    <h2>Budget</h2>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      Each idea should provide a budget for its implementation. A second and separated
      budget (compensation budget) defines the amount of money allocated to the
      minister and his team (see Ministerial Cabinet below) for the whole time span of this idea.
      An third budget will also be allocated for sensors. An idea submitter cannot reduce the amount
      redeeming the censors below a minimum level, it can however define a higher
      amount if he considers that the risk is higher that selected minister would not respect the
      expected goal. At the opposite, the compensation budget for minister can be
      zero, but maybe then, no candidate will postulate for such idea as
      interesting as it can be for the society.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      A super-idea can have his own budget, but it must also list the sum of
      all budgets of the child ideas recursively for eacjh voter to see the
      global cost of what the super-idea.
    </p>

    <h2>Perimeter</h2>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      The idea must define a perimeter outside of which the action should not
      apply (in our example this might be that wind or human powered
      vehicles will not be concerned by this speed limitation law).
    </p>

    <h2>Identifiant d'idée</h2>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      Last an Idea ID is attributed by the system once the idea has been duly
      registered. Such ID must be chosen for the distance between two IDs
      differs from at least three characters (a typo of one or two characters
      should not lead to a valid ID). For the same reason, only either the O
      letter or 0 digit, la lettre l (lowercase L) or the digit 1, and so on,
      should be used inside idea identifiers.
    </p>

    <h1>Ministerial Cabinet</h1>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      A minister may appoint other persons (experts, specialists,...) in order
      to get help to addressing his goal. He will then share with them the
      compensation budget equally during their time of presence. These
      persons will constitute the <b>Ministerial Cabinet</b>. The minister has all
      power to modify his cabinet at any time. The budget will be shared
      prorata temporis of presence in the Ministerial Cabinet.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left: 5%">
      <u><b>Risk:</b></u> a minister could delegate his role to a so called expert
      that will bypass the random selection system of candidates. In the other
      hand a minister cannot be hampered in its action for the pretext he
      engages a expert that takes over his role... Puppet politician already
      exist today, how to reduce this risk here?
    <p>

    <h1>Ideas extension</h1>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      It may arise that some idea get almost realized but not completely and
      having the same minister and ministerial cabinet to completely
      achieve them would make more sense that performing again the whole
      process of idea election. In that situation, an idea-extension can be
      submitted by the minister. All voter for the original idea will get
notified by such idea extension, but still a majority of electors
      will have to vote for it for the extension to be granted. Elector
      that explicitly voted against such idea will also be notified, but
      not the other voters.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      Idea extension may concern time span extension and/or budget extension
      and/or perimeter extension. It will have to be justified in order for
      the voter to understand and agree with it. The censor may amend or
      annotate the explanation of the minister, he may also trigger the
      justice if the extension differs too much from the original idea. The
      exposition delay is, here too, defined by the idea submitter (here
      the minister), to find a good balance between the remaining time to
      realize the idea and the necessary time to obtain the necessary vote
      quorum. If elected, such idea extension does not imply any candidate
      selection, this is the minister that will implement it.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      Idea extension can also be used by the minister when there is conflict
      between a sub-idea and a super-idea or between ideas of a tree he has
      the charge to implement as described above. This may lead to the withdrawal of a sub-idea
      that would differ completely from the goal of the voted super-idea.
    </p>

    <h1>End of execution</h1>
    <p style="text-align:justify;">
	A minister and the associated censors end their role once the maximum
	duration time for the idea has ended. Minister or censor may also
	resign in which case they will have to refund the money they received
	for their role, unless major force (decease, diseases duly
	validated,...)
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      the elector that have been voting for this idea or super-idea then get notified and can
      provide a mark on the way the idea has been executed. This notation
      will increase or decrease the minister selection weight which will
      either reduce or increase its chance to be
      selected again as minister if he postulates for a minister role in the future.
    </p>


    <h1>Tax System</h1>
    <h2>Citizens</h2>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      The budget sum of all ideas accepted during a given year is added to the
      tax amount that will be applied to citizens the year after. An idea
      that spans several years will have a proportional fraction of its
      budget allocated each year. Each idea may also define the way its budget
      will be allocated over time (for example 80 % the first year, and 5 %
      the four following years).
      </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      The way to balance this taxation between people (what we will call
      taxation model) based or not on their revenue, patrimony, age,
      volunteering in a general interest cause... is outside the scope of the
      GBI.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      When voting for an idea, voters will see the cost they will have to pay
      for this idea, in regard to the existing taxation model and their
      position in that model. They will thus be able to have an approximation
      of their tax amount for the following year, which they could take into
      consideration to define the way they vote to come during the year.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      It should be provisioned enough money to address the budget in regard to
      past years expenses and currently running ideas. If provision is not
      large enough, firstly voted ideas of the year will be active, the
      others will stay pending for budget acquisition or, at the will of the concerned minister,
      will start without fund or with privately owned funds, reimbursed
      later to the minister. The state has not to carry any interest load of
      a loan the minister could have contracted waiting for the availability
      of the funds to execute the idea he has the charge to execute.
      A pending idea is thus one that has been elected but has not yet
      started, its execution time is shifted up to the time its funds
      will be allocated.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left: 5%">
      <u>Risk:</u> the lack of provision may lead idea
      submissions to take place at a given time of the year to have more
      chance to get a budget sooner, leading to a load peak for voters
      which in return would lead the obtention of the 50% voter quorum
      difficult to obtain for ideas during this period and thus should
      counterbalance this load peak.
    </p>


    <h2>Companies</h2>

        <p style="text-align:justify;">
	  As companies have no right to vote for ideas, they shall not be taxed to
	  to provide the budget of any idea. However companies do consume resources
	  (natural and human resources) as well as public services
	  (transportation, police, justice...) that the society provides
	  them. They should thus be taxed regarding the use they do of natural and
	  human resources in particular regarding the cost of resource recycling they consume
	  for their activity and for their public services usage.
	</p>

    <h3>Natural Resources</h3>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      For natural resources, a company will be taxed proportionally to the
      recycling cost of the product they build/transform. This implies that the
      company provides information about the transformation applied to the
      natural resources or already transformed resources used as base of
      their production, in order to estimate the cost of recycling.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left: 5%">
      <u>Risk:</u> rely on foreign suppliers to do the ugliest
      part of resource transformation, for that reason, importations should
      also be taxed in regard to the recycling cost of the imported products.
    </p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
  The state structure that has to be setup to evaluate the recycling cost of products (expert,
  laboratories, buildings, operating costs, controls, and so on) will be completely paid by
  enterprises and divided proportionnaly to the paid tax on product recycling. This way ecological
  enterprises will carry a smaller part of the cost than big polluters.
</p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      Following the same principle as VAT, a &quot;RCAT&quot; for <b>Recycling Cost Added Tax</b>, could
      address this cost, usually left to the society by bankrupted
      companies. By natural resource, it must also be take into account the
      surface used for buildings and the reference for such tax would be the
      destruction and redevelopment cost to get back to pre-human activity status (status the
      land had before the human even have used it): the cost of removing
      all building, concrete, roads, soil pollution, and so on.
    <p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      The value of an agricultural field when no chemical product has
      been used (for example) during decades and soil pollution is absent can be considered
      equivalent (thus maximal) to pre-human activity status. Forests that
      have been managed for long-term during centuries can also be assimilated to this highest level
      of value as there is no recycling cost: just wait for the vegetation to grow in order to
      get back to pre-human status equivalent. This is not the case for a ruined building
      as one can wait for plants to grow, once trees will get their maximum
      height, the building and the traces of human activities will still be visible,
      and/or soil pollution will still have measurable consequences on flora and fauna,
      for example.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      In consequence, a company that recycles resources and products will get compensated
      accordingly to the cost the civil society would have taxed a company doing
      the opposite action. For example a company which action is to recycle
      garbage will get paid according the difference of value from the garbage
      and the resulting recycled product. Such company will still have the cost of the
      transformation process but will benefit of the added value of their recycled products
      on the market.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      Adding the recycling cost to product manufacturing should lead companies to
      select the best raw materials and best transformation process that ease
      recycling.
    <p>

    <h3>Human Resources</h3>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      For human resource, recycling means maintaining employability of workers
      by mean of training, and/or role change. What should count
      in this evaluation is not the salary, but the difference of
      employability of an employee when he entered the company with its employability when
      he left it.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      The state should compute yearly statistics for a meaningful set of role
      categories and publish for each role:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li> The average unemployment duration, referred as <b>UNEMP</b> in the following</li>
      <li> The average employment duration, referred as <b>EMP</b></li>
      <li> The average annual salary, referred <b>SAL</b> in the following</li>
    </ul>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      We can then define the <b>Employability Ratio</b> (ER) for a role category by:
    <p>

    <p align="center">
      <b>ER(role) =  EMP / (UNEMP + EMP)</b>
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      This is the average fraction of time a person having this role is
      employed
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      The difference of employability when the employee enters and leaves a
      company gives the variation of the fraction of time an employee will
      stay unemployed. The cost to the company is the
      <b>Employability Tax</b> (ET) which is defined by the
      product of Employability ratio variation times the average
      unemployment times duration times the average salary for the role
      employee had:
    </p>

    <p align="center">
      <b>ET = [ ER(entrance role) - ER(exit role) ] *  UNEMP(exit role) * SAL(exit role)</b>
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      This can mean the company will receive money for the ET if the employee
      has increased its employability on the market:
    </p>

    <center>
      <img src="er_increase.png" name="ER increase" align="center" border="0" alt="negative Employability Tax, money returned to employer"/>
    </center>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      But of course this also means that if a company does not take care of
      maintaining employability of its employees, it will have to pay a tax
      according to the decrease of ER:
    </p>

    <center>
      <img src="er_decrease.png" name="ER decrease" align="center" border="0" alt="Employability penalty due to lack of investment in employee"/>
    </center>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      It means a company does not carry the load of unemployment for a given
      employee that leaves the company, but only the degradation of value
      an employee had on the market by staying in the company. And if the
      ER value increased during the time the employee stood in the company,
      this one would be reward for that.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      But, to avoid a company to artificially change the role of employees
      before firing them and this way avoid paying for the ET, during the
      average duration time of the new role a <b>penalty ER</b>
      is introduced which lead the ET to be the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>First the ET reward expressed above should be prorata temporis
	of the employee time in this new role compared to the
	average employee duration for that role.
      </li>
      <li>
	Second we introduce the notion of Penalty ER,
	which corresponds to the ER the employee had N years before his role
	change, where N is the duration the employee has spent in its new
	role (see diagram below). The difference of ER compared to the
	entrance ER times gives a second ET that is added to the first ET
	prorata temporis to the complement of the first ET time ratio:
      </li>
    </ul>

    <center>
      <img src="er_role_change_transition.png" name="Penalty ER" align="center" border="0" alt="Employability Tax reduction over time after employee role change"/>
    </center>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      That way just after the change of role the benefit of the role change is
      little because the time spent in this new role is little (prorata
      temporis). At the same time the Penalty ER is the one the employee
      has in his former role just before changing of role, thus the penalty
      ET is maximum because the time ratio for penalty is also maximum.
      This is as if the employee had left without having changed of role.
      As time passes and as the employee has more experience in this new
      role, the benefit ER increases and the penalty ER decreases both
      because the Penalty ER decreases in value but also because the time
      ratio for it is reduced as time passes. After EMP time in the new
      role, the time ratio for the penalty ET is null and the ET is equal
      to the ET calculated previously only considering the entrance ER and
      the exit ER (see examples below)
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      It is assumed the indemnity provided to unemployed people is
      proportional to the average salary for the role the employee had in
      his previous professional experience (and not linked to its real own
      salary). The cost of unemployment is charged on all salaries of
      active persons, sort of mandatory insurance for unemployment. As a
      consequence the unemployment cost is paid by the citizen only, the
      company pays only the loss of value of their employee when they
      leave, this should lead company to provide training to their people
      that have real value on the market for their employee and also
      promote them when a given job is decreasing.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      Why not making difference when an employee resign and when he is fired?
      Because it may leave due to pressure from the employer.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      Why not making difference when an employee resigns for a new job? Because
      it does not change the need for a company to maintaining
      employability. This does not forbid company to contract conditions
      (if conform to law) for the employee to engage for a given period of
      time in the company for the new role.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      Last the ET should be calculated each year and redeemed or charged to
      companies each year, as if all their employee were leaving at the end
      of year and were arrived at the end of the previous year. This way it
      takes care of company bankruptcy.
    </p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
  The running cost of such institution that evaluate UNEMP, EMP, SAL for all professional categories
  the buildings, the people that work there, ... are carried by the enterprises under the form of an
  added tax proportionnel to the number of employee the each company had during the year (partial time
  employee count prorata temporis compared to a full time employment)
</p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      <u><b>Example 1:</b></u>
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left: 5%">
      Mr Doe has been employed for 10 years in company A always in the same
      role category, which at the time he entered the company had the
      following indicators: UNEMP = 1 year, EMP = 5 years, SAL = 60 k&euro;. After
      these 10 years, Mr Doe leaves or is fired by company A, but the role
      indicators are now: UEMP = 2 years, EMP = 5 years, SAL 50 k&euro;
      <br/>
      The ER at entrance was: 5 / (5 + 1) = 0.83
      <br/>
      The ER at exit is: 5 / (5 + 2) = 0.71
      <br/>
      The ET for enterprise A is: (0.83 - 0.71) * 2 * 50 k&euro; = +12 k&euro;
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left: 5%">
      But if the indicator for this role had been better (unemployment duration
      reduced for example) company A would have received money accordingly,
      without having done anything!
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left: 5%">
      We see that the unemployment indemnity for the former employee will be
      100 k&euro; in average (for two years), this is not the company that
      pays this amount, company only pays the variation of cost the unemployment
      for this role has between the time the employee has been engaged and the
      time the employee leaves the company.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      <u><b>Example 2:</b></u>
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left: 5%">
      Mr Doe has started at company B as role 1 (UEMP = 1, EMP = 3, SAL = 50
      k&euro;) after 5 years, role 1 indicators are (UEMP = 2, EMP = 3, SAL =
      45 k&euro;) at that time company B to avoid the corresponding ET cost
      decides to promote Mr Doe to role 2 with a salary of 50 k&euro; (no
      salary change) eventually providing him an adapted training for this new
      role . After 6 years in this role 2, which we assume has not changed
      significantly over years (UEMP = 1, EMP = 6, SAL = 70 k&euro;) Mr Doe
      resigned for another company.
      <br/>
      The ER at entrance was: 3 / (3 + 1) = 0.75
      <br/>
      The ER at exit is:  6 / (6 + 1) = 0.85
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left: 5%">
      As Mr. Doe has had an experience duration greater or equal the EMP in
      his last role (6 years), the penalty ER is ignored and the company is
      rewarded the following ET:
      <br/>
      ET = (0.75 - 0.85) * 1 * 70 k&euro; = -7 k&euro;
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left: 5%">
      But if Mr Doe had left or was fired after one year instead of 6, the
      penalty ER would have played:
      <br/>
      Penalty ER = 3/(3 + 2) = 0.6
      <br/>
      The ET would have been:
      <br/>
      ET = ET1 + ET2
      <br/>
      ET1 = (0.75 - 0.85) * 1 * 70 k&euro; * 1/6 = -1,16 k&euro;
      <br/>
      ET2 = (0.75 - 0.6) * 2 * 45 k&euro; * 5/6 = +11,25 k&euro;
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left: 5%">
      Where from the total ET = +10 k&euro;
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left: 5%">
      Company B would have to pay 10 k&euro; for the Employability Tax. This mechanism
      avoid the company to try reducing the ET by changing the role
      category of employee just before firing them. The fact that Mr Doe only
      stood one year while the average employment duration is 6 years also means
      this experience at role 2 is too short to have a complete value and Mr. Doe
      may experiment difficulties being engaged under this role in the future.
    </p>


    <h3>Costs of Risks</h3>
    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      If an employee dies due to risk inherent to the role he has or due to
      lack of security addressed by the company, this one will have to
      redeem the heirs to the last salary the employee had for the time
      remaining to his retirement. Any membership fee for retirement shall
      be performed as if the person was still alive and would provide a
      retired amount up to the average life expectancy for the role the
      employee had. Proving the origin of the injuries would be a decision
      done by the Justice (nothing automatic here are their are ways to abuse
      the system by employee as well as employers)
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      For that Reason Company should have insurance for any risk they can bring
      to the resources, whether human or natural. In particular an
      Industrial company that manipulate dangerous chemical substance that
      could explode or pollute the grounds should contract an insurance in
      regard to this risks and this way be able to fix and compensate any
      catastrophe which could be generated by its activity. This system
      should also limit the occurrence of company filing for bankruptcy after
      a such catastrophe due to the colossal charges it would cause.
    </p>

    <h3>Use of public Services</h3>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      Companies should also be taxed in regard to their use of
      transportation infrastructure, common and public services, as well as
      for regalian services. If for the first ones the tax can be
      proportional to the use (transportation, postal services when
      publicly owned...) care should be taken for the access to Justice to
      be possible even for little or emerging companies. The tax could be
      for example indexed on the turnover that each company had the
      previous year (no tax for the first year of exercise of a company).
      Note that losing a pursuit does not mean having no cost for such
      small companies. In other words, each company will have to pay a tax
      for justice which amount will depend on their turnover whatever they
      are suing or not.
    </p>

    <h3>Controlling system</h3>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      The cost of controlling (real use of natural and human resource, adequate
      risks insurance subscribed and proper declaration of public services
      usage) must be carried by the companies' activities. This cost can
      be balanced between companies taking into account each company's
      turnover, here again. The fine amount in case of infraction should be
      chose high enough to compensate the lack of risk to be caught by the
      controlling system. Less tax implies less means for the controlling system
      resources, thus the fine amount in case of fraud must be increased in
      consequence for dissuasion: in other words, the product of the fine
      amount times the frequency of controls or difficulty to be caught, must be constant.
      Note that the amount of fines is not used to carry the functionning of this
      controlling system, but to cover the cost that would have been left to the civil
      society if such controlling system was not present. The functionning cost of the
      controlling system is independent from the fraud and is funded by enterprises.
    </p>

    <h1>Constitution</h1>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      Once an idea has been retained but before a minister get selected, it must
      be validated for conformance with the constitution. A constitutional council
      is needed for that and can
      be solicited by the president of the executive power, president of
      the justice power and by some associations recognized of social interest
      (like association acting against corruption, for human rights...).
      </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      The constitutional council can also give a status without external
      solicitation. In case of rejection of an idea, the constitutional
      council must justify its decision based on the constitution.
      If an idea is rejected by this council this will lead it
      to the same fate as if it was not elected.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      The definition of a constitution is outside the scope of GBI,
      though one could allow the GBI system to add, modify or remove
      rules of the constitution, it should be done with some additional
      validation process outside the perimeter of this proposal (higher ratio
      of voter for this constitutional idea...)
    </p>

    <h1>Executive Power - President Role and interaction</h1>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      As stated in introduction, the GBI in addition to be a complete
      legislative power (unicameral) also partial covers the executive power that needs to be
      completed by a presidential role as of today in many democracies
      (directly or indirectly elected by voters). The frontier between
      actions that the president can take and those that he cannot take
      alone should be defined precisely by the constitution and is out of the scope of this
      proposal. However, some decision the president has the power to take
      alone could still have the form of a <b>presidential idea</b> with
      maybe smaller quorum of elector necessary for its adoption (relative
      majority of voter with 33 % of favorable voters for example).
      Also a dedicated budget could be
      defined in advanced for such situation and needed actions. Such idea
      will be implemented the same as other ideas: by candidate selection not
      by the president or by its cabinet.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      Last, some actions and responsibilities should stay under the exclusive
      responsibility of the president and not be managed nor validated through GBI
     (nuclear power, weapon use, war, etc.).
    </p>

    <h1>Referendum</h1>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      Referendum are just a particular case of submitting a idea to the GBI
      system. Electors as well as the executive power can propose idea. But only
      presidential ideas can lead to a mandatory voting from all electors.
    </p>

    <h1>Execution Conflicts</h1>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      It may arise that two elected ideas enter in conflict. For example, a
      first elected idea would tends to increase security of car drivers in
      case of accident by introducing a geolocation automated devices in
      vehicles that would detect the occurrence of an accident and trigger
      emergency alert, while another elected idea (possibly already
      completed) would for example control the personal information
      collected from people including their geolocation all along the time.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      For that reason a set of prime ministers has to be selected (randomly
      from a list of candidates and for a fixed duration) to arbitrate between
      ideas in conflict and define their respective perimeter of application.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      Instead of one single person, having an odd number of prime ministers
      randomly selected in a list of candidates (same criteria as for
      minister to postulate to this role) sould reduce the risk of
      arbitrary decision.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      The prime ministers action should only take place when a minister claims
      a conflict against another idea. They should modify each idea
      perimeter in order for the conflict to disappear. Only 3 prime
      minister will be randomly selected to arbitrate a conflict (more could
      harm the effectiveness of the decision).
      But a broader set of prime-minister can be selected in regard to the
      expected load of arbitration they will have to address.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      During prime-minister resolution conflict, concerned ideas are suspended,
      this means their time span is extended, but their budget stays the
      same.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left: 5%">
      <u><b>Risk:</b></u> There is the risk a party provides under his
      master super-idea a set of useless ideas that could be used to
      trigger a conflict with other ideas that they are against. This could
      undermine idea with little compensation budget due to the fact the
      minister would not be compensated during the conflict resolution.
    </p>

    <h1>Random selection</h1>

    <h2>Candidacy conditions</h2>
    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      As described above, minister, censors and prime-ministers have to be
      randomly chosen from a list of candidates. We also saw that
      postulating to any of these roles implies to respect some conditions:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
	Only voters can postulate to any of these roles
      </li>
      <li>
	One cannot postulate to any of these roles, if it has ever been
	condemned for corruption, no prescription.
      </li>
      <li>
	one cannot postulate to the role of censor if it has been
	condemned three times for censorship abuse.
      </li>
      <li>
	one cannot postulate to the role of prime-minister if it has
	been condamned three times for censorship abuse.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      For all roles, we could also add some conditions,
      like to not be in prison, and so on.
    </p>

    <h2>Weighted candidacy</h2>
    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      Now we should also valuable successful role execution, by mean
      of weights given to each candidate.
      Each voter having postulated at least once for a role would
      receive a weight which value would be 1 initially. This weight would
      increase for successes and decrease for failures of executions.
      The random selection of candidates takes care or relative weight of all candidates
      in order to provide proportionnal chances to be selected according to the weight
      of each candidate.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      For example, to select between 3 candidates or respective
      weights 1, 3 and 6, the random selection will randomly choose a number from 1 to 10.
      if the value 1 is drawn, candidate 1 is selected. If one of the value 2, 3 or 4 is drawn,
      candidate 2 is selected. If one of the values 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 is drawn,
      candidate 3 is selected for the role.
    </p>

    <h2>Weight Evolution for a Minister</h2>
    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      As briefly introduced above, the initial weight for a candidate is 1. At the end of
      idea implementation, voters for this idea are asked to give a rating about their
      satisfaction about this implemented (voters than voted against
      explictly or implicitly are excluded from this step). This rating can be the
      usual 5 values one (1 - totally unsatisfied to 5 - totally satisfied).
      From the average rating <b>M</b> (which is a floating point number between 1 and 5)
      a weight multiplicator <b>V</b> is derived from the formula <b>V = 2^(M-3)</b>.
      For example:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li> V is 1/4 if the average rating is 1 (lowest) the candidate weight will be divided by 4</li>
      <li> V is 1/2 if the average rating is 2: the candidate weight will be divided by 2</li>
      <li> V is 1 if the average rating is 3: the candidate weight is unchanged</li>
      <li> V is 2 if the average rating is 4: the candidate weight is doubled</li>
      <li> V is 4 if the average rating is 5: the candidate weight is quadrupled</li>
    </ul>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      Of course all intermediate values of <b>M</b> will give intermediate values for
      <b>V</b>  according the the formula mentionned previously.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      This way, minister that could show good skills in execution are more likely
      to be selected for a next idea they would postulate for. While getting a poor rating
      would not eliminate the former minister but let newcomer having more place
      to "take their chance" for a future selection.
    </p>

    <h2>Weighting Censors</h2>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      Another weight than the one associated to the minister role, as seen above
      can be used to keep trace of the censors actions. For example, a censor that
      could demonstrate the corruption or  result falsification of a minister and lead
      him condemned could have would have his censor weight multiplied by 10.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      But a censor that would have be condemned for
	  censorship abuse would have its weight divided by 5 for each such
	  sentence received (up to 3 in his life).
    </p>

    <h2>Weighting Prime Ministers</h2>
    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      The role of prime minister is difficult to evalute for several reasons:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li> a prime minister never acts alone but in a cohort of 3 prime ministers</li>
      <li> The decision they take is always partial, and may never satisfy perfectly all
	ministers concerned by a conflict (Else, there would not be a conflit to solve)</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      However, it could be possible to let the minister that have been in conflict for their
      idea to give a rating to the group of three ministers they have been arbitrated by.
      We can use the same mecanism to translate from rating to weight multiplicator as for
      ministers evaluations by electors.
      if a conflit between ideas is has been arbitrated in a completely unfair manner, the
      resulting rating will most probably be 3 (average of  1 and 5), thus the weight
      multiplicator of 1 would not change the prime minister rating.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      Use a different system that would reduce the weight of prime ministers in such
      situation would expose them to blackmail for rating from ministers. At the opposite,
      prime ministers that would have satisfied positively both parties in conflit even partially
      and thus would have found a good compromise would get better rating than for the
      unfaire arbitration we just saw and would be favored compared to this first case. For
      example, a conflit for which leads to a rating of 3 and 4 will give an average of 3.4
      which translates into a weigh factor of 1.4 approximatively.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      Doing that way, leverages candidates with good skills for a given role.
      Professional politician could well emerge, but should be sanctioned
      the same as newcomers and be deprived from their right to postulate
      if they get condemned for corruption, abuse... even if their weight
      had increased a lot over time.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      This different from today's professional politicians
      is that they are elected based on their ability to let people believe
      in what they promise today and their ability to have people forget what they
      promised yesteday. The proposed system here would for sure keep professional
      politician
      for their ability to satisfy voters and thus respect what they voted for.
      Would that make worse professional politicians as of today?
    </p>


    <h2>Secrecy and control of the random selection process</h2>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      The random seletion process briefly introduced above brings
      challenge to address:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>guarantee fair selection and the freedom from fraud
	by fraud</li>
      <li>address scalability that will be need as it may be expected a lot of ideas,
	ministers, censors and prime minister to be selected over time</li>
    </ul>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      A first approach could be to have loto-like election, this would allow
      any candidate for an election as well as any elector to be able
      to assist to the selection process. It could even be broadcasted to
      public media. Each selection must be performed under the control of a bailiff
      and would use a mechanical machine (not computer science based here, as there
      is no way to control from the outside the fairness of the random
      selection from the outside). A statistical control can however be made about the
      randomness of the generated serie of number such mecanism generates, but this
      dos not guarantee that the system has not been tampered and that from time to
      time it generates a number that is the one asked by an external source of
      information.
      The problem here is also cost and scalability of such system.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      To address these points, we could rather rely on a two levels selection process and
      use computer science to provide seamless automated election without compromising
      the randomness of the selection process by doing the following way:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
	A first organism, the <b>submitter</b>, assigns candidates to one or several
	numbers in an range rearding their respective weight. The assignation is not
	important here, it may be the order the candidates have registered for example.
      </li>
      <li>
	Each candidate receives from the <i>submitter</i> organism a ciphered message
	containing the number(s) he has been assigned to, but without the key to
	uncipher it.
	This key will be sent by the <i>submitter</i> to a second organism the
	<b>generator</b>, which does not know the numbers assigned to the candidates.
	The <i>generator</i> will also be provide the reference for this selection
	(idea ID, etc.) with the information of range in which to randomly draw a number.
      </li>
      <li>
	Once the <i>generator</i> has randomly selected the number in the
	requested range, it publishes the selected number beside the selection reference
	and the secret key it received from the <i>submitter</i> for that selection and which
	permits to uncipher all messages sent by the <i>submitter</i> to the candidates.
      </li>
      <li>
	the <i>submitter</i> organism reading the result designates the selected candidate
	and all candidates with the knownledge of the secret key now
	published by the <i>generator</i>, can be sure the <i>submitter</i> has not
	reassigned numbers knowing the result from the <i>generator</i> organism.
      </li>
      <li>
	The <i>submitter</i> organism and any citizen including the candidates will also
	be able
	to control the randomness of the number issued by the generator by computing
	statistics of all selections performed over time, this to avoid the <i>submitter</i>,
	having detected some inconsistency in the randomness, to assign some candidates
	to some numbers that could be more likely to be drawn.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      For the voting system example provided in annex, the <i>EIB</i> could be the
      <i>submitter</i> organism and the <i>VA</i> could be the <i>generator</i>
      organism. The inverse could also be possible.
    </p>

    <h1>Return to civil life</h1>

    <h2>Ministers</h2>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      Care must be taken for ministers once they have completed their
      idea to be reinserted into civil life. For that reason if they can provide
      evidence they are actively seeking for a new job a former minister
      will receive a composensation up to twice the minimum legal salary
      and up to they time they find a new job but not for a longer time than
      the time they spent as minister. The amount they will receive per month
      ranges from the minimum to twice the minum legal salary depending
      on the rating they received at the end of their role as minister. If a
      minister resigned, he will not get any compensation.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left: 5%">
      <u><b>Risk:</b></u> a balance has to be found between the level
      of mean provided to get back to civil life and the risk to have people
      postulating to such role just for the money they will have during
      the role and the compensation they will have after to carry their
      return to civil life. Care must also be taken for the global cost
      of this feature as there may be a lot of minister in a given period
      of time...
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      Other members of the ministerial cabinet are not concerned by such
      compensation as they were not chosen randomly, but for their skills. As
      such they did not had to abandon their work and can add this experience
      as expert or specialist for the ministerial cabinet on their resume. This
      professional experience is the continuity
      of their day to day work and if they were successful they would have more
      chance than before to find a job, including a new role of expert in another
      ministerial cabinet.
    </p>

    <h2>Censors</h2>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      Censors will receive the lowest legal salary at most for the duration of
      their activity as censor during the unemployment and if they could justify of an active
      search for a new job. The Censor does not take a lot of risk for his role
      he can also just do nothing it will be difficult to control its work, so it
      is difficult allocate more without a way to evaluate the work performed
      by censors.
    </p>

    <h2>Prime Ministers</h2>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      At the end of their mandate prime minister will follow the same process as
      the minister, and obtain
      a variable reserve of fund to cover their period of unemployment following
      their role as prime minister up to a duration equal to the time spent as prime
      minister. The rating used will be the average of all rating
      received during their period of activity in this role. As before they will
      have to justify to be actively seeking for a job.
    </p>

    <h1>Political Party</h1>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      By political party we mean here any group of persons sharing a common
      view and/or ideology, this may well be also a philosophical group, a lobby, a syndicate
      for examples.
      . Such entity can register a
      &quot;<b>tag</b>&quot;
      to the GBI system which they will be allowed to add to any existing
      idea, whatever is their author.
      <b>Tags can be either positively or negatively applied to an idea</b>,
      meaning either that the corresponding political party approves or
      rejects such idea. Of course such political party would tag positively
      the ideas they submit, but by mean of  super-idea or more simple by mean of
      tag, a political party can approve the ideas they are not the author of but with which
      they agree. This avoid idea duplication and thus leads more chance for a same idea
      to be visibile by different types of electors and thus to be elected.

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      An idea can thus receive
      several tags from several political parties. This gives the choice to voters
      to define filters to list ideas in phase with their own criteria. We can imagin rich
      logical expression like:
      <i>
	list ideas for which tag A or B is present and positive and tag
	C is absent or not negative
      </i>
      and if the voter has no time and trusts the political parties these tags come from,
      vote for or against such ideas without even understanding them.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      The tagging of an idea
      requires authentication to avoid tag usurpation.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      The advantage for the electors is to not be oblided to be either in the box of a
      given party of in the box of another party, but to pick ideas from almost everywhere
      in regard to their own convictions.
      However political parties have a plac and can propose a set of coherent ideas in one
      or severl domains.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      We could also imagine a system where elector can subscribe to a given
      set of tags (using filter based on rich logical expression as seen above)
      define a maximum budget and have the system voting for
      the ideas matching such filter(s) while its cost
      is below an elector defined amount and while the global elector defined
      budget has not been exhausted. Selected ideas by the filter that would be out
      of budget would be available in the tool for more attentive consideration in order
      for the elector to takes its own decision.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left: 5%">
      <u><b>Risk:</b></u> This mechanism may lead some elector to completely
      delegate their voice and not becoming concerned by political activity nor in the future
      of the country anymore. However they will vote for idea, thus in a way the
      would participate in the decision process of their country.
    </p>

    <h1>Idea submitter consideration</h1>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      It could be added as an option that idea submitter get rewarded when an
      idea they submitted has been elected. The reward could be financial
      and visible as such in the total cost of the idea. This amount could
      even be defined by the idea submitter inside a limit range fraction
      of the total budget of the idea. At least the cost of the idea submission
      should be return to the submitter if this idea has been elected.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      If this is an amendment of an idea that has been retained this reward will go for 2/3
      to the original idea author and 1/3 to the author of the elected amendment, unless
      this one has decided a more advantageous dstribution to the author of the idea in his
      amendment.
    </p>

    <h1>Conclusion</h1>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      The objective of such political system defining a new legislative
      power and partially redefining the executive power is to involve people closer to
      the decision process and letting them keep a eye on the way it is executed.
      There is many options (becoming or not a voter, relying on automatic tag voting)
      that can let people just
      live they political life as of today, but at least for more concerned
      citizen, there is room to propose, room to choose, room to control
      and room to act without make a full time job of politics.
      While traditional political party would still have their
      place in that system.
    </p>

    <h1>Annexes</h1>
    <h2>Voting System Example</h2>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      GBI implies frequent election for many submitted ideas.
      Relying on new technology is necessary to reduce cost for the society
      and time for the citizen. However care must be taken to provide vote
      privacy and control. The following is a proposal of system that is in
      fact independent on the GBI but is provided just to illustrate
      the feasibility of the frequent voting requirements of GBI.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      For that purpose two independent organism can be defined:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
	<b>Elector Identity Bureau</b> - EIB, which registers electors
	and authenticate them
      </li>
      <li>
	<b>Virtual Assembly</b> - VA which contains exposed and adopted
	ideas, search engine and voting system with filtering feature to help voters.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>EIB</h3>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      This bureau can be a centralized or distributed organism, each city for
      example registering its citizen based on official passport or ID card
      and a centralized legal register of person banned from the GBI system for
      corruption or other justified reasons. Its first role is to attribute
      an <b>Elector ID</b> to each electors. An Elector ID a public number with
      integrated checksum (to detect typo error). An Elector is also given
      a secret pin/password/passphrase, which the elector is the only one to know
      (like PIN for sim cards, credit cards, and the like). EIB may renew
      ID from time to time and will communicate the new ID by postal letter
      as of today or ciphered emails if the elector has registered a GPG
      key and email to the EIB portal.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      EIB provides an SSL portal to the electors on Internet that has several
      purposes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
	Register a GPG public key and email (after having authenticated
	with the Elector ID)
      </li>
      <li>
	Hide the IP address of the elector terminal to the VA, and more generaly
	anonymize the exchanges between the elector and the VA.
      </li>
      <li> Provide a single sign on for the VA</li>
      <li> Place to report fraud about Elector ID usage</li>
    </ul>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      The EIB is thus the only organism having the correspondence between an
      Elector ID at a given time and the elector person it has been assigned
      to at that time. In particular the VA does only know the Elector ID and
      has no information about the Elector itself. At the opposite we will see
      that EIB has no information about the exposed or voted ideas.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      A terminal used for voting by an elector (laptop, smartphone,
      tablet...), when connecting to the VA, has to pass through the EIB.
      EIB acts then as web proxy. The VA portal must <b>not</b> be accessible
      directly from Internet for interacting with electors (idea reading, filtering, voting)
      but a page of information should be telling how to configure the Elector
      terminal to vote in total privacy. VA access is ciphered by SSL, thus
      EIB has no way to know about the votes and actions done by the elector when the
      communication is established from the terminal to VA through the EIB
      Proxy. Initially and for a limited time, the Elector
      first authenticate to the EIB proxy which generates a token the
      terminal will use during the session with VA. The VA will receive
      this token and interrogate the EIB on its validity and Elector
      ID correspondence) and can then load the elector context (configured filters,
      voted ideas, and so on) and then present it to the elector through the ciphered
      established connection.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      When the user will perform a vote on the VA, the VA will provide
      the token and Elector ID to the EIB, which will validate the
      authenticity of the Elector to the VA and the fact the token has not expired.
      The EIB can thus count the number of vote a given elector has performed,
      and control the active status of the elector.
      The fact the session passes
      through the EIB proxy hides from the VA the original IP address and
      enforce anonymization of Electors to the VA. In particular if the terminal
      is not properly configured to allow this level of anonymization to the VA,
      the EIB during the authentication phase must refuse the connection to the VA
      and provide in return to the elector a clear message about the failure and the
      mean to fix it.
    </p>

    <h3>VA</h3>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      The Virtual Assembly is the place where is gathered and registered the
      ideas. This registration and payment is done without interacting with
      the EIB, submitter must be publicly identified and be registered.
      This is the <b>VA idea submitter portal</b>
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      The VA is also the place where --- through the EIB proxy and with EIB
      authentication --- votes take place. Once authenticated to the
      <b>VA voter portal</b> each elector has a view of exposed ideas
      including the ones he has already voted for (or explicitly against),
      He can also see the ideas that are currently executed (having
      information about minister and ministerial cabinet, censors and
      budget used, the action status report provided by the minister, and
      so on).
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      The VA voter portal offer the possibility to forget
      the ideas he has voted for or against in the past, The voter can
      reactivate it afterward but won’t see votes done before that time.
      Doing so avoids the voter to rate the minister once the idea has been
      completed as the voter is no more associated to this idea. It is not
      notified about idea extensions for past ideas and so on.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      Elector should have the ability to search ideas by keywords, by end of
      exposing date (date at which nobody can vote for it and its vote
      count is evaluated), by authors, by tags and combination of those
      filters. The possibility to browse ideas up and down in a tree of
      super-idea and sub-ideas should also be available (when a super-idea
      contains sub-ideas the Elector rejected, he may want to vote
      manually for some other sub-idea except that one).
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      Of course if an Elector has voted against an idea, some color code
      could show that status for such ideas but also for the super ideas
      that due to that vote cannot be voted for. Same thing when voting for
      a super-idea all sub-idea should have color code telling the Elector
      has voted for implicitly. View should also allow an Elector to see
      not yet voted ideas only, voted for ideas or voted against ideas.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      A customizable color could also be associated to filter the user would
      configure to focus on some type of ideas.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      Once an idea has been
      voted for, some statistics about the number of votes are sent back to
      the EIB for control:
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      When a voter votes for an idea, EIB get solicited for Elector
      authentication and can count the number of votes a given Elector has
      done but EIB cannot know for which idea the elector has voted.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      EIB can thus during a given period of time compare the total number of
      votes summing the number of votes per electors with the total number
      of votes received from VA statistics by summing the amount of voter
      for each idea that has been voted for during that time. These two sums
      should be equal in absence of fraud.
    </p>

    <h3>Securing Elector Terminals</h3>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      The terminal or user device has to be secured. Choice must be left to
      the elector to define the security of his terminal by itself or to rely
      on vendor terminal certified as secure by the EIB or even provided by
      EIB. EIB should also provide good practice for a secure Election
      process, including social engineering menace and all that goes with
      (phising, etc.)
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left: 5%">
      <u><b>Risk:</b></u> the risk is that EIB by mean of such terminal
      provided by itself get information of the votes done by the elector
      and even modifies votes done without the elector noticing.
    </p>

    <h2>Structural Costs</h2>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      The cost of such legislative system (idea election) and executive system
      (minister, censors and prime-minister) is contained in the budget of
      the elected idea. This is thus the electors that define their level
      of tax and accordingly their level of services. Majority being the
      decision maker, should be reduce the case where a small subset of the
      population (a lobby or a company) passes laws that only benefit to
      this minority.
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:justify;">
      Remains for the state some structural costs to take into account:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
	All regalian services, even if companies contribute to the service
	they use (Justice in particular) based on their turnover (for example), citizens
	have to contribute to these services under the form of global tax that the
	chosen taxation will load balance between citizens. Remains to define the
	ratio between the global private sector contribution and the global citizens
	contribution
      </li>
      <li>Constitutional council members and means, as of today</li>
      <li>
	Prime ministers, which are not compensated from
	an elected idea as they have to arbitrate perimeters and priorities
	between them, no representation role, less budget need but more
	people to compensate.
      </li>
      <li>
	The voting and idea submission system (and its
	controlling entity) EIB and VA in our example.
      </li>
      <li>
	The candidate selection system and its controlling entity, which were designated by
	the submitter	and the generator entities in this proposal. Those roles could be taken
	by the EIB and VA to reduce
	the administrative cost of theses entities.
      </li>
      <li>
	A super censorship that may be elected by the
	people to control the censors not to have collusion with the
	minister they have to control
      </li>
    </ul>
